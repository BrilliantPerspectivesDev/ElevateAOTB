      "If you've ever thought that - even for a moment - I want you to know something: That exhaustion isn't a failure. It's an invitation.",
      "You're tired of the endless cycle: Falling back into old patterns you thought you'd overcome, feeling like you're not good enough for God's best, trying harder to be better but staying stuck in the same struggles, learning things that never seem to stick no matter how hard you try.",
      "You know who you are in Christ... but you don't know how to live it out. You feel guilty when you rest, anxious about the future, and exhausted from trying to apply what you've learned through sheer willpower.",
      "What if the problem isn't your commitment? What if you're just missing the right permissions?",
      "Graham Cooke and Dionne van Zyl have walked this exact journey - from the exhaustion of performance Christianity to the rest of identity-based Kingdom living. They've discovered something revolutionary: You don't need to try harder. You need different permissions."
