THE ART OF THINKING BRILLIANTLY

Disc 1

	I am going to talk to you this evening about building the right mindset. Every action is rooted in the thought that produced it. There is a reason why the Father wants us to take every thought captive to obedience. If a thought is not captive to obedience then we become captured by it in a wholly unappealing way. Your thoughts are either going to make you or they are going to break you. They are going to advance you or they are going to prevent your growth in the Spirit. Every action is rooted in the thought that produced it. Wrong thinking, therefore, makes a way for negative behavior.   
	Let me read James 1:5-8 to you*.* Hold onto your horses, I am going to read the Bible to you, *Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials.* So that is a good thing, right? That means you should go, "Trial?\! Yahoo\! Happy birthday to me\! Woohoo\!" You should be calling your friends, "I've got a trial today\!" And your friend is going to go, "Dude, I'm jealous\!"  
	*Knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. Let endurance have its perfect result so that you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing.* The whole point of a trial is to give you something, not to take anything away from you. It is to advance you. It is to add something to you. That is why you should be joyful because God allows in His wisdom what He could easily prevent by His power. He adds a trial to you because it is His way of bringing you into a fresh place and a fresh anointing. When we are partnering with God, we always have to partner through laughter. We partner with God in joy. That means we partner through laughter. We partner through smiling, through grinning because there are no Eyores in Heaven. They have all been changed in the twinkling of an eye on the way up\!  
	*If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea driven and tossed by the wind, for that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord being a double-minded man unstable in all his ways.*  
	There is only one way to think. There is only one thought to have in any situation, and that is the one that Jesus is having about it. When we are learning how to walk with God, we are submitting ourselves to the way that He thinks. We are submitting ourselves to the way that He perceives that situation to be from His own heart, and His own affection, and His own intentionality. We are submitting to the way that God wants things done so that we can actually receive an upgrade. 	What if every single situation had an upgrade attached to it? I believe it does. In the generosity of God, every single situation, good, bad, or ugly, has something tangible in it for us to receive and enjoy. *Count it all joy when various trials and situations occur* because the whole point is that you would be lacking in nothing in that situation. So your thinking has to release you to a point where you receive something no matter what the circumstances are. It is impossible for us to receive when our thinking is not renewed in that situation. Think of it this way, every circumstance you have is an opportunity for you to think brilliantly about God, about yourself, about the situation you are in. The mind of Christ is the most profound, most dynamic, most incredible, amazing way of thinking ever. He sees things that you couldn't imagine by yourself. The mind of Christ opens you up to see what Heaven is doing. Right thinking will always generate faith.   
	Here's the point: Your starting place always guarantees the outcome. If you start from a bad place, the outcome is not going to be what you want it to be. But if you start from the place that God has actually assigned to that issue, to that situation, to that circumstance, He has assigned a starting place for you. The place where you can come and stand and connect. When you find that starting place, and you stand in it, and you embrace it, and you confess it to the Father, then your outcome is guaranteed from that place.   
	In every situation one thing is of paramount importance and that is that you discover the starting place in that situation where God can connect with you and prepare you for the upgrade that is actually there, that you could see it. Sometimes we get so hung up with the situation, we can't see anything. We let it get so up front with us, so up close, we can't see anything.  
	Every situation carries an upgrade with it. Your starting place guarantees the outcome. The role of the Holy Spirit is to teach us the starting place in each situation we find. That is part of the reason why we grow up into all things in Christ because we are learning where is our point of connection in this situation with Him. When you get a different situation, you are looking for that point of connection because you know that one exists. It is there because of who He is and because of how He sees you, and because He has this joyful job of making each one of us Christlike.   
	Jesus was never stumped by anything. He knew the point of connection with His father. He would often say, "I only do what the Father is doing. I only say what He is saying." So in every situation your point of connection is the Father is saying something here, and He wants to do something here, and I need to find that starting place. The Holy Spirit is going to show me because my starting place guarantees the outcome in the circumstance that I am facing. Therefore, every situation we are in has a real critical point of excitement. It is a 'Yahoo\!' moment. If you go through a day without having a situation, you are going to get withdrawal symptoms\!  
	Scripture says, *Of Him are you in Christ Jesus.* That is your starting place. "Father, I am in Christ so that everything that should come into this situation, comes to the Jesus in me." Heaven is attracted to Jesus. Why do you think God put you in Christ in the first place? Why do you think He put you into Christ and put Christ in you? Because all of the Kingdom, all of Heaven is attracted to the Jesus in you. That should make life extremely interesting\! "I wonder, Lord, what is being attracted to Christ in me right now?"   
	We need to break the cycle of fear, and anxiety, and worry, and doubt, and unbelief because a double-minded man is unstable. I am not sure what a double-minded woman is. Maybe it is only the men who are double-minded\! This may be the only time that men admit that it is genderless.  
	Everything comes to the Jesus in you. Everything comes to your new nature. It doesn't matter what your struggles are. The Father is pretty clear in Himself about how He sees you. He says that you are a new creation. All the old things are passed away, everything has become new, and all things are of God. What does that mean? It means there were two creations in humanity. One was pre-cross, and one was post-cross.   
	Pre-cross in the Old Testament people could have the Holy Spirit come upon them, and they lived in a visitation culture. There were seasons and times God came. He visited. He came upon people . He gave them special graces, and powers, and anointings to do certain tasks. That was one creation, visitation culture, God could come upon them.  
	But a post-resurrection culture changed all of that, and a whole new people group emerged who don't have God living on them, they have God living in them. So now the New Testament is not a visitation culture at all. It is a habitation culture because the presence of God is with you. Jesus said the Kingdom shall be in you. You carry the Kingdom with you everywhere, and God is not coming upon you anymore. He is rising up from within because He has already taken up residence. You are a new creation. You are a new people group never seen in the earth before. That is what new creation means.   
	We live in a habitation culture, and what we are doing is we are maintaining the habitat. It is called abiding. We are learning how to stay, how to dwell, how to remain in who Jesus is for us. We are learning that in every situation I face, God is always in this situation with me because I carry Him in the inner man of my spirit. We are learning, therefore, that God is not touching us from outside, He is actually rising up from within because He has already taken up residence in us.  
	I thought that was good news\!	  
	The good news is your old nature is dead. Yahoo\! We are learning how to be alive to God. God gives us permission, "Consider yourself dead to sin, but alive to Me." The enemy would like you to consider yourself alive to sin and potentially having difficulties with God. He is such a liar. The Lord says, "No, I want you to consider yourself dead to all those things that would disqualify you and alive to Me because I am the Great Qualifier."  
	So we are learning to be focused on our real identity in Jesus. That means, therefore, that we seek His perspective and His abilities in every situation. I want to know what Jesus is thinking. I want to know what He is praying because I want to pray the same thing. I want to think the same way. I want to see this issue the way He sees it, and I am waiting until I get that revelation. I am not doing anything. I want to know what my starting point is because I want my outcome guaranteed from that place.   
	Scripture says it is Christ in us, which is the expectation of glory, the confident expectation of something glorious occurring in this situation. We don't want to be in Christ and still falling short of the glory of God. Every one of your situations has a potential to carry some glory within it because Jesus is glorious and if He is living in you, that is going to make you somewhat glorious yourself. So look at your neighbor and say, "You are starting to shine\!"  
	Scripture says, *In Him we live and move and have our being.* That is situational. It is circumstantial. It is for every area of life. In Him we live. We move. We have our being. He is connected. He wants to make that connection stronger through the situation that He allows, and often, the situation He provokes.  
	Our starting point is that we are a new creation in Christ. All the old is passed away. Everything has become new. Everything is of God.   
	Here's the thing: Every issue you face, that issue is already in Christ because He is in you. You can't have a life in Christ and then have an issue as a separate thing. That is weird thinking. Every issue in your life is in Christ because you are. That is the starting point.  
	Okay, somebody breathe\! It feels like there is black hole there. I feel like I am going to get sucked into a wormhole and end up in a parallel universe or something.  
	If you are in Christ, so is your situation. It makes sense, right? Talk to me\! I think I am up here talking Hindustani or something.  
	Whatever issue we face is already in Christ. That is good news. It means you can't fail. You are in Christ, so is the problem you are facing; it is in Jesus. That would be a 'Yahoo\!' moment.   
	What that means is every issue you face is already assigned an outcome that God wants to generate. Now that is thinking brilliantly.  
	Every issue you are facing has already been assigned an outcome that God wants to generate. So you are feeling pretty curious right now, huh? You are going, "Cool\! Then I should just take all my problems for a spin and find out what all my upgrades are\!"  
	Never let a circumstance rob you of your identity. Jesus is all and in all. He is your divine advantage. Your starting place guarantees your outcome. 2 Cor. 2:14 says, *God always leads us in triumph.* That is a good starting place. Start with a win in your thinking. "I am so going to win\!"   
	People accuse me of being triumphalisitc. Guilty as charged\! I resemble that remark\!  
	Why would you want to live any other way? Why would you want to make allowances for being defeated when you could make allowances for winning every time?  
	In your starting place then, in every situation, "There is a victory for me in this situation and I am so going to find it\! This situation is designed to draw me into a space with God where I win something." *He always gives us the victory in Christ*, 1 Cor. 15:57. Therefore, we fight from victory, not towards it because victory is your starting place. You are not trying to get somewhere in this situation. What if you are already there and you just need to know where there is? There is a breakthrough that has been assigned to you. There is an outcome assigned already. There is a victory assigned to you. Brilliant thinking says, "I am just going to worship the Lord until I get a revelation of what that is, then I am going to move."  
	That is why rejoicing and thanksgiving is so critical because what are we rejoicing over? We are rejoicing that God is with us and He never leaves us. We are giving thanks because He has assigned an outcome to my issue, to my situation, to my problem. I am giving thanks already in advance because I can't live in Jesus and not be favored. It's against the law of life in Christ Jesus. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus says, "You are in Him. You are subject to all that He is vulnerable to in Heaven," and He is vulnerable to a lot on your behalf. He ever lives to make intercession for you.   
	What is He doing? He is praying that you will get it. He is praying that you will see it. He is praying that you will own it. He is praying that every trial will advance you, that every trial will make you grow up, that every trial will make you happier, more stable, more sensitive to Him, more brilliant in life as it is designed to do because every trial has an outcome from Heaven already assigned to it, and it is your pleasure to discover the will of God. That is thinking brilliantly.  
	In Christ we never start with a deficit. We begin with the outcome that He sees over us. *I can do all things in Christ who empowers me,* Phil. 4:13. I can do all things in Christ. I can do this\! That is the attitude of the Holy Spirit. He can do everything. He is a genius\! He is always saying, "Graham, tell them I am a genius because they live like they don't know\!" He is the one who comes along and says, "I can do that\! You want some help with that? I am really good at that. I know exactly how to do that. You want me to talk to you about that? I will talk to you about that. You want a bit of advice? I have got some great advice. I know exactly what to do in that situation." To Him everything is doable. Everything is doable, "I can do that. I am really good at that. That is my specialty," and you discover that everything is His specialty because He is a genius, and He doesn't mind letting you know. "Yep, I'm a genius. That's why I got this job because I am a genius. I love problems. I eat problems\! I love every issue because every issue is in Jesus, and I know exactly what He is praying, and I am working in line with what He is praying."  
	This good news is starting to look better, eh?  
	Here's the thing:  Because you are in Christ, it is the perfect starting place.  It banishes all negative thinking, all low self esteem, all weariness, and all passivity.  Problems refresh you. Problems have a way of just blessing the socks off you.  
	What if refreshing is attached to every problem? Wouldn't that be just like God to take everything that the enemy wants to make you weary? God wants to do everything the opposite of what the enemy is doing. The enemy wants to make you tired, weary, fearful, anxious. God wants to make you rested, refreshed, joyful, and full of trust and "Yahoo, I love this life\!"  
	So our focus on the beginning of something is really about being refreshed. Jesus said, *Out of your innermost being shall flow rivers.* He is so generous He is not content to give you one river, He wants to give you several. What that means is when you have rivers flowing out of you, you are either going to spend a long time in the bathroom or you are just going to learn to be extremely happy all the time, and refreshed\! What if every problem is designed to refresh you and not make you weary, and not make you tired, and not make you anxious, but do the exact polar opposite? That would be good news. That would be the Gospel. That would be Heaven coming to earth because there is no weariness in Heaven, and you are connected. What if we are learning how to live a life above tiredness, above weariness? What if we are not designed to be empty, we are only designed to be full? Your starting place guarantees your outcome.  
	So our focus at the beginning is in being empowered in our thinking so that our emotions can become energized, otherwise our emotions are going to feed off all that negativity, and then we get into a place where "I don't feel like doing this," and "I don 't feel like doing that," and our mind has talked us out of something. Our emotions and our thinking are conspiring against our spirit when they should be submitting to it.   
	You know when your emotions are running the show because your thinking is weak. A negative mindset establishes your inability, "I can't do it. I'm no good. It's too big. We are not strong enough. We are not big enough. We are not powerful enough. We feel like grasshoppers in our own sight." Or we say things like, "Ach, it's not really me. I'm too scatty. I can't do that. That is not my strong point. Really, I am totally disorganized." What we are doing all the time is we are confessing to something that we are not rather than confessing to who we really are.  
	Jesus is in you. You stopped being scatty when He came in. You stopped being disorganized. You stopped being this thing that you attribute to your old nature because that is dead. You have a new nature. You need to start confessing in line with it. *I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,* who empowers  me, who enables me. There isn't anything I can't learn, and there isn't anything I can't do with the help of the Holy Spirit and six friends\!  
	Don't reinforce a negative. There is a difference between that which is true and that which is the truth. In Christ there is always a higher level of truth than the facts. Somethings may be true, but the truth sets us free. Speaking the truth in love is not about telling people all their shortcomings in the nicest possible way. "I am saying this in love, brother." No you are not, you lying little toad\!   
	Speaking the truth in love is not telling someone's shortcomings as nicely as possible because that is not the truth. That is only true. But the truth is they are dead in Christ and all that stuff is done away. The truth is, "This is who you are in Jesus," so when we are speaking the truth in love we are not putting someone down nicely, we are elevating someone brilliantly. We are saying to people, "You don't need to be doing that because this is who you are," and you speak the truth in love and you empower them. You make them want to become that person. "Dude, this is who you are; you are brilliant, you are this, you are this. This is who Jesus is for you. That is who Jesus is for you. You can do this because He is with you," and you are speaking the truth in love because the Truth is a person, and His name is Jesus. So you are speaking Jesus to people when you speak the truth in love. "This is who Jesus is for you. This is why you are going to have an amazing, astonishing life. This is why God is going to lift you out of the ordinary into the extraordinary because no one can be ordinary in Jesus. It is not allowed\! He is in you. One of His names is wonderful, so what does that make you? It makes you at least potentially astonishing."  
	The starting place is the love that God has for us and our conviction about His purpose for us in the situation that we are in. The truth is every issue is already assigned an outcome that God has designed for you. The truth is He makes all things work together for good. The mind of Christ allows us to turn a weakness into a joyful vulnerability to His goodness. You are so vulnerable to the beauty of Jesus.   
	Come on\! If He showed up right now, you would all be gaga. You would all be like Homer Simpson looking at chicken. You would be drooling\! You would be looking at Him. You would be lost in who He is. Why? Because He is irresistible, and you are designed to go gaga. So, guys, when you go to bed with your wife tonight, you are sleeping with Lady Gaga. I'm not sure whether that is a good thought or what. I don't know if that would make it into the lexicon of brilliant thoughts, but anything to put a smile on your face.  
	It is our privilege to take a negative thought captive to a better one. "Think again” is the essence of all repentance. If all your thinking has brought you to a place you don't like, have another thought\! It could just be the making of you. There is a better thought out there. Why don't you go for the better thought? Stop wallowing around. You know where that thought is going to take you, so could you please change it? Your angel is flashing up messages on your computer, "Could you change that thought, please? You have had it for the last nine months. You know it's killing you. Stop it\!"  
	Every day we wake up with a mindset that works for us or against us. A negative mindset kills our creativity, and it robs us of power. Romans 8:6 says, *A mind set on the Spirit is life and peace.* It produces a way forward and it allows us to enjoy the circumstances and the discovery that we are going to make. It allows a strength to emerge and be developed. God always provides us with a way through. 	That is why there is no frustration in Heaven. Can you imagine Heaven being frustrated? All the angels scratching their head around the throne going, "Well, I don't know. I'm stumped\! I don't know what to do. I mean, I am so frustrated right now\!" Imagine the Father saying to Jesus, "You know, I am so frustrated\!" No\! There is no frustration in Heaven. There has never been any frustration in Heaven. Frustration is a construct from the world around us.  
	We are in Christ. Our starting place guarantees our outcome. What if all frustration has a heavenly counterpart? What if frustration is actually a sign that an upgrade is present? Frustration is God stopping you walking down a road that He doesn't want you walking down, so you come up against this block, and then you have to turn yourself around and walk in a different direction. What if frustration is a "Ding\! You are now safe to move around the Kingdom\!" What if it is a moment, what if it is a sign that the Lord is saying, "No, that is not going to work. This will work, though." What if it is a sign that an upgrade is present, and you need to stop worrying enough to look around and find it? If you are frustrated by anything, God is trying to get a message to you, "Excuse Me. Is anybody at home? I see the lights are on, but...Hello\! Upgrade here\!"  
	Frustration is a confession that we are powerless, that we are obstructed, that we are stymied, that we are invalidated. That is not throne-room thinking. Throne-room thinking always declares our place of advancement. *I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me.* Throne-room thinking declares who I am in Jesus. 	Now we need to do some work on this, but here's the thing: If you are going to work on this, could you do it happily? Could you do it joyfully? Like, "This is going to be so cool\!"  
	The Holy Spirit is challenging you to rethink your assumptions, rethink your starting place. The power of the heavenly minded is that our hearts and our minds are always in sync with who God is for us. Whatever is bound in Heaven can be bound on earth. Yahoo\! Whatever is loosed in Heaven can be loosed on earth. Sometimes frustration is the Lord saying, "You should be binding something round about now, and if you are going to bind that thing that is stopping you from moving forward, then you need to also loose something that can actually propel you forward.  
	Here's the thing: At least can we have the decency to be intrigued? "I wonder what You are up to? You are always up to something." There is only one way to live in the glad tidings of great joy and that's happily, joyfully. It is intentionally. It is with a sense of intrigue. "I know the Father loves me. I wonder what this situation is for. What are You doing?"  
	The two best questions, you have heard me say it so many times, are found on the Day of Pentecost. "What does this mean?" and "What must I do?" Those are the two greatest questions because they have upgrades all over them. What does this mean? "I don't want to miss anything that You are doing. What are You doing? I know what the enemy is doing. I know what that person is doing. I know what this situation wants to do, but what are You doing? What does this mean for You?" "What does this mean for our relationship?" is a great question. "What does this mean, Lord? What is my part in this? How do You want me to position myself? What do You want me to think? How do I partner with You in this situation? Where is my starting place? What is my outcome?"   
	"Ah, right\! I get it\! I see it\! Uh-huh. Okay\! I want to go there."  
	Every situation carries an upgrade.  
	What if the Kingdom equivalent of frustration is endorsement, that God wants to endorse something about you in Jesus? Here we are saying, "I can't do this. This is not working. I am so frustrated," and the Father is saying, "No, let's change that thinking. In this situation right now I am endorsing something for you in the Spirit. I am setting you up for something. I want you to know something about yourself. I want you to know something about who I am for you in this situation."  
	Endorsement is our place of advancement. What if there is a promotion in that situation in the Spirit? What if there is a promotion just in life? How many of us right now are in difficult jobs, thinking about leaving? What if the Lord doesn't want you to leave? What if He wants to promote you? You might be interested in asking anyway. What if He wants to authorize something? In fact, what is the Lord authorizing in your life right now? What is He saying 'Yes' to? What is He giving you permission for? If everything is 'Yes' and 'Amen' in Christ, what is He authorizing? What has He sanctioned? What is the outcome? What has been assigned to your current situation? What if God wants to upgrade your favor? What if He wants to affirm to you the next level of your identity? What if He wants to stimulate your faith so you can believe Him for something He has always wanted to give you? What if He is trying to create some fresh expectation in your heart?  
	Here's the thing about frustration: To really get the best out of it, frustration has to turn to celebration. If you stop being frustrated and started celebrating, you would be in a whole different space, and so would your circumstances. You can make your circumstances bow the knee to the Christ in you. It starts with a thought. What does this mean for you and I, Papa? How do I stand with You in this?  
	It is not enough for us to believe. We must become fully persuaded. That is the journey that we are on. Faith is not difficult to acquire. Faith works by love. When people say to me, "I don't really have the faith for that." Well, don't concentrate on faith. Concentrate on being loved. If you are loved, faith will come because you know you are loved. Love gives you a power that results in faith. Faith is a consequence of being loved. Faith works by love. When you know that you are the Beloved of God, when you know that He adores you, faith is not difficult to acquire. Trust is easy because you are trusting in the greatness of Somebody who is a million times bigger than you and isn't it great to walk with that Person in my circumstances?   
	Faith works by love, and we are learning how to be fully persuaded. That is what Paul wrote to Timothy in 2 Tim. 1:12. He said, *I am absolutely convinced that God is able to keep that which I have committed to Him.* A mind set in Christ always chooses a brilliant starting point that guarantees an amazing outcome. In 2 Kings 6 it is the story of two guys in the same situation, Elisha and his servant. One guy had a different starting point from the other. The other guy's starting point was fear, worry, anxiety, "Alas, my master, it is over\! There is an army around the town. They are all looking for you. They are going to kill me as well in case the anointing might have rubbed off. I am dead. Alas, it is over. It is finished\!" and he can't understand why Elisha is smiling. Elisha is looking out there going, "This is cool\! Whoa\! Hey, Dude, there is more with us than there are with them\!" And the servant is going, "Note to self: Don't give him yogurt last thing at night\! No pizza for breakfast\! Lay off the dairy produce."  
	"What do you mean there is more with us than with them?"   
	Elisha had a different starting point for that situation. He knew this was it. This was the moment they had waited for. This was the moment where for that whole entire generation of people, the Arameans would stop bothering them from this moment on. He saw it for what it was, "This is my victory\! This is the thing we have wanted to see for ages, and here it is right now."   
	All the other guy could see was a crisis. All Elisha can see is, "This is it\! This is our victory\! This is going to be so cool\!" and so he goes walking out to these guys, and they have all got laminated photographs of him, and they are all looking at him, "This looks like the Dude\! But it can't be because he is right there, unless he is an idiot\!" And they all start putting the photograph in the back pocket of their Levis and looking at him.  
	Elisha says, "Can I help you?"  
	"Well, we are looking for Elisha."  
	"I know where he is. Walk this way," and he takes them on a fourteen mile hike to where the King of Israel is waiting, and the King is jumping up and down going, "Ooh, ooh\! Can we kill them?\!"  
	And Elisha says, "Naw, let's just feed them and send them home. They are done. I stuck a fork in; they're done\! They're toast\!"  
	Then it says, *And those Arameans never returned.*  
	 Outcome. Two guys, same situation, but their starting place was completely different.   
	You have the authority, and the power, and the favor to choose the right starting place for your thinking in the situation you are in, and it is your joy, it is your pleasure to choose the right place, to be curious, to be intrigued, "I wonder what You are going to do, Papa?"  
	Caleb went with a bunch of guys, and these twelve guys were like the best of the best. There was the military version of American Idol in every tribe. They had Military Idol. Every tribe went, and they had these competitions to find out who is the nastiest, most courageous warrior we have on our books. They all went, "Yeah, our dude rocks\!" So all twelve are paraded. They are all big guys. They are all up for it, and they are sent out.   
	Ten of them came back completely unmanned. These were tough men. They saw giants out there, and they became fearful. They felt like grasshoppers and were completely unmanned. Why? Because their starting point was not the same as Joshua and Caleb.  
	 Caleb came back really excited. It's like, "Dude, there are giants out there, and they are flipping huge\! This is going to be so much fun\! They are going to be our prey, can you imagine it?" That was his starting place. Guaranteed the outcome for him. "There are giants out there. It's going to be so cool because if God is pleased with us, and He is, then they will become our prey. God is with us\!" He couldn't wait to get started\!  
	Forty years later in the battle, there is one last stronghold, which is actually Hebron. They have had victory after victory, and Caleb elbows his way to the front and he gets in Joshua's face and says, "Listen, Josh, dude. You were there when Moses promised me my inheritance. That's it\! All the giants are congregated. They have got nowhere to go. They are going to be vicious. It's going to be great\! But I want that stronghold as my inheritance." Why? Because his starting point was majesty. It was sovereignty. He couldn't wait to go up against those guys. He was like, "Push off\! Get your own inheritance. That's  mine\! I want this one\! I am eighty-odd years old, and I'm still strong, and I'm powerful, and I can do it because I am a kick-butt kind of guy in the Kingdom\! There might not be another fight for years, so I want this last one. You all go off on vacation. I can deal with this\!" His starting point was majesty and sovereignty. He couldn't see anything other than a victory. "God is with me." Your starting point always guarantees your outcome.  
	If you check it out in 1 Sam. 17, when David came up against Goliath, he made six amazing statements. Four of them he made to Israel, and two of them he made to Goliath himself. He knew the battle was the Lord's. He knew the outcome before he even set out there. He knew the outcome. He knew that he wasn't going to die because he had a prophecy from Sam that he was going to be king. He is not king yet, so he can't die. "Goliath, this is your unlucky day\!" and God looked at his heart and says, "He is a man after My own heart." Why? Because his starting place with God was God's starting place with him. "He is a man after My own heart. He can read My heart in every situation he is in." That is what it means. "He can read My heart. He can read My affection in every situation He faces. He can see Me in it waving\! He can read My heart in every problem. He has a good starting place."  
	David said, *I would have despaired unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.* He did not choose the negative. He chose the opposite. "There is a goodness of the Lord in this situation, and I am going to see it. I choose to believe in the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living."  
	When we work from victory, we can partner with God for the outcome, and the outcome is always more glorious than you imagine. The outcome for God is not just your situation being resolved, it is you growing in Christ. It is you taking on some substance. It is you taking on some majesty and some glory, and some faith. It is you being advantaged. It is you receiving more favor. It is you growing in favor with God and man.   
	In Christ, we are always more subject to refreshing than dryness. That's a brilliant thought right there. You are subject to refreshing. Why? Because there are rivers of living water inside you. You are vulnerable to the power of God. You are not vulnerable to the enemy at all, unless you want to be.  
	A renewed mind is focused on majesty. Our starting place guarantees the outcome. We are in Christ. Therefore, so is every issue we face. Every issue is assigned an outcome that God wants to generate for you.  
	So your mission, should you choose to accept it, is before you go to bed this evening ask the Lord some questions. What outcome has been assigned to me in the situations that I am facing? Your glory, your strength, your power is finding that outcome.   
	What is the outcome? You can trace it back to the starting place, "You mean I should have been standing here all along?"  
	"Uh-huh."  
	"Okay, then," and I am going to find the grace to be excited, to count everything as a joyful thing. Why? Because this situation can't be here except that I get upgraded through it. So I want my upgrade.  
	There are unclaimed upgrades all over this room. It is because we are not finding our starting place in the situations that we are facing. Every situation you are in right now is in Christ with you. What has He assigned to you? What is He doing?   
	Let's be curious. Let's be intrigued. Let's ask the Lord. Let's be joyful. Let's be happy when a problem comes because it is set to advantage us in some way. Let's choose our starting place. Choose the place where you are going to stand. It is the place that gives you visual advantage. You start to see things that God is seeing.  
	Let's pray.

	Father, thank You. Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You. Thank You this is the beginning of days for us. This is turn around time. Thank You that we are entering days of unending brilliance. Thank You that we are rediscovering Christ within, the expectation of glory. Thank you what we are exploring every situation for signs of Your presence, and they are there. Thank You that You always give us a future and a hope. Thank You that You are increasing our joy because you are always joyful. You are the happiest person I know. You have the sunniest disposition of anybody I have ever met.   
	Thank You that you work everything together for good. Thank You that we can count it all joy because You are up to something in our lives, and thank You for giving us the resident genius of Heaven, the Holy Spirit, who is sent to disclose to us what is to come. He tells us the outcome. He tells us where to stand. He helps us in our thinking because He is amazing, and He is our helper.  
	Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You.  
	So in Jesus' name, I proclaim over this house and all who come inside these walls, I proclaim that everybody who comes into this house will have their mind renewed in the Spirit. They will begin to think differently just by being here, that hope will rise up in our hearts, joy will explode out of our spirit man, that we will begin to see the hand of the Lord, that hope will take hold of us, that we will come under the divine advantage, the favor of the Lord Jesus, that our thinking would be massively renewed in Jesus' name.   
	I proclaim to you that this weekend is the beginning of times. There is a time of times coming into your life, and this weekend is the beginning of a whole new regeneration in your personality, in your way of thinking, in your way of seeing. The Lord is saying, "I am taking you from the basement to the penthouse. I want you to have a room with a view. I want you to have a room with a view in the Kingdom. I want you to see all that is on My heart for you. I want you to know everything that results out of My affection for you. I want you to know that I have assigned blessing, and favor, and promise, and provision for every situation that you are encountering, and I am going to teach you how to think it, see it, move towards it, take hold of it, use it, become it, establish it, embrace it, and then give it away."  
	So, Father, in Jesus' name, we just give You thanks because this is our upgrade, and we are taking hold of it. We are taking hold of it. We are taking hold of it. We are taking hold of it. I want this way of thinking. I want it\! I want it\! I want it\! I want it\! I want it\! I WANT IT\! I want this way of thinking. I want it with everything in me. I want to think like Jesus thinks. I want to see the glory everywhere. I want to see the goodness of God. I want to be bathed in it. I want to be immersed in it. I want to drown in it, and come back to life in it\! I want it. I want to embrace it as a way of life, that from this moment on I can't think any other way except the way that You think.   
	So may it be so, Father. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen\!

Disc 2

	Let's pray.   
	Father, thank You. What a great day. Holy Spirit, we absolutely love You. I love the way that You adore Jesus, the way the You are so faithfully committed to taking everything that belongs to Him, and showing it, and giving it, and disclosing it to us, and empowering us to step into it, embrace it, and become it. I love Your reverence for the Father and for Heaven, and for bringing Heaven into the earth so that we may taste the powers of the age to come. I love Your work in the body of Christ. I love Your work in the world. We realize that You are doing so much more behind our backs that you are in front of our face, and we just want to catch up with You. Thank You that you are committed to each one of us really being set free and being on track in our own time and timing with the purposes of God. You are so welcome here. Please come have free reign to do what You do best, to stimulate, to inspire, to lift up Jesus in our estimation, and to make us aware of our identity in the Christ. For His sake, amen.

	I am going to read the Bible. 2 Cor. 10:4 says, *For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but they are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and we are ready to punish all disobedience whenever your obedience is complete.* What that means is your obedience makes you ready to get revenge on the enemy.  
	*You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.* The way we think rules our life. Our mindset is either a fortress for the enemy or it is a temple for the living God. A fortress is built to keep something out. A temple is built to invite someone in. The Holy Spirit is destroying speculations, theories, surmisings, guesses, pulling down any way of thinking that is against the true knowledge of who God is for us. He is empowering us into a way of thinking that generates the power of obedience.  
	Speculation looks at things outwardly, in other words, in the way that it may affect us. Speculation affects our soul, our mind, our emotions, and our will. It can generate thinking and emotions that put us on the floor and leave us with a substandard experience of who God is for us. The Holy Spirit restores our confidence in Christ so that as we consider the issues from within through the inner man of the Spirit, we are elevated to the level that God wants us to live on.   
	I want to talk to you this morning about remodeling because that is what I believe God is doing with us. He is remodeling our lives. He is renovating us. He is restoring us. He is rebuilding us. He is renewing us. He is restoring our thinking as a prime piece of our spiritual walk.  
	Stress is always an inside job. Stress is not caused by externals. You can't say, "Well, this is really stressing me out. This person is really stressing me out." Stress is not caused by an external thing. It is caused by the way that you perceive it. It is caused by the way that you think of it because that is the door you open to it or not.   
	Our old nature is a product of our place in the world. Therefore, it is subject to intense negativity, fears, anxiety, irrationality, believing the worst. We speculate negatively, and we have grown up in the world with a strong attachment to doubt, to pessimism, and to unbelief. If those are the things that you are always fighting off, what that is doing is it is highlighting that you have an attachment to those things. In the spirit realm, we don't get rid of a negative by focusing on it. We get rid of a negative by focusing on its replacement. What is God doing? He never asks you to focus on a negative. He always tells you who you are. He always tells you, "This is what I am doing," and when we focus on our own identity and we focus on what God is doing, the negative is dealt with as a consequence not as an act in itself. When we focus on doubt, pessimism, and unbelief, then stress is often the result of those things.   
	But our new nature is a product of Heaven. It is the way God thinks about us in Christ. He has no bad thoughts towards us because He sees us in the lens of Jesus Christ. Why do you think God put you into Christ in the first place? It is so that He would always have something that He could smile at. He put you into Christ, in Him you live and move and have your being. The good news about the Father is He is totally not a schizophrenic\! He put you into Christ so He could approve of you, He could accept you, He could receive you, He could bless you, He could increase you, He could advance you, He could upgrade your life and walk in the Beloved. He has no bad thought towards us, only a desire to see us conform to the image of Jesus. He is not ashamed to call us brethren. He is not angry with us because He got angry with Jesus.	  
	The question is was Jesus punished enough for sin? It is not a trick question. It is a vital one, though. Was Jesus judged enough for sin? Did the Father pour out every last ounce of wrath, and anger, and indignation upon Jesus? So He hasn't got any left then? This is the good news\! He doesn't have any left then because if the Father has any capacity to be angry in this life, then the cross of Jesus is not worth anything.   
	We can't afford to be schizophrenic about the Gospel. It is either the most powerful, astonishing, amazing, incredible good news ever, or it is a lie. Either it is glad tidings of great joy or it is just another con. You can't have a loving God who is always angry at stuff that we do. It doesn't compute. God is not disillusioned with you because He never had any illusions in the first place\! He knows exactly who you are. You haven't disappointed Him. You haven't upset Him because He is made of stronger stuff. The very idea that we could disillusion God is just too funny for words\!  
	Here's the thing though: All confrontations between the flesh and the spirit are a source of joy to the Father. Why? Because He loves being your Deliverer. He is deliberately, and with great pleasure, going to make war on your flesh. Like, Bonus\! Let me say that again: All confrontations between the flesh and the spirit are a source of joy to the Father because He loves being your Deliverer. So He is going to go up against your flesh, not to condemn you about anything, but to release you from the tyranny of it. He loves to make war on those things. He is passionate about your freedom.   
	The whole idea of remodeling comes from the identity statement of Jesus in Isaiah 61, the first seven verses, when He talks about that He is anointed by God to bring the good news, and to heal the brokenhearted, and to proclaim liberty and freedom to captives. In that passage He uses the key word "instead" five times; that God would give you a garland instead of ashes, that He will give you the oil of gladness instead of mourning, that He would give you the mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting (what we call depression these days), that He would give you  joy instead of humiliation, and that He would give you a double blessing instead of shame.   
	Everything that God is doing in your life is about your freedom. It is about your release. It is about your upgrade. It is about your blessing. There is never going to be a situation that is not about your freedom.  
	The word "instead" means "in place of, as an alternative to," in preference to this God wants to give you something else instead. So the consequence of that action, that anointing in your life, is that the waste places in your life get rebuilt. You get repaired. You get restored. Remodeling is a way of thinking that repairs and rebuilds our perceptions of something so that we are empowered to be restored by God in His fullness. Remodeling helps people to reinterpret problems and find solutions by changing their frame of reference in which the problem is first perceived. Remodeling is part of renewing the mind. It is a transformational exercise that engages us with the mind of Christ. It is changing our mindsets from the old self to the new self so that our experience of God can become more rich and more powerful. Remodeling is about being renewed in the spirit of your perception so that God can really transform your life. When we consider ourselves dead to sin and alive to God, something must shift in the way in which we view ourselves.  
	I was talking to a guy in Chicago last year, and in the conversation he just said, "You know, I hate myself. I can't think of anything good about myself."   
	So I looked at him and I said, "Can I ask you a question?"  
	He said, "Sure."  
	I said, "Which self is doing the talking?"  
	He said, "What do you mean?"  
	I said, "Well, you just said you hate yourself. You can't think of anything good about yourself. Which self is doing the talking? That doesn't sound like your new self. That sounds like your old self. Which self is doing the talking?"  
	What are we listening to? Which self is doing the talking here? We have an old self and a new self. The new self is renewed in knowledge. It is renewed in the knowledge of Jesus and who He is for you. Only the old self would use the word "hate" and be incapable of seeing goodness.  
	So I said, "Dude, you are listening to the wrong voice."  
	And he got it\! He said, "So what do I do about that voice then?"  
	I said, "You ignore it, unless you have a hobby of sitting in church yards listening to corpses because it is just about as dumb as that\! It is a dead voice. It comes out of your past, but it is a dead voice. It belongs to a corpse. you don't do anything about it. You ignore it. You don't engage with it. You don't enter into a debate with it. It belongs to a dead person\! You don't deal with an old voice, you practice listening to the new voice."  
	Our new nature has a voice that causes us to rejoice, to give thanks, and to discover the heart and affection of God for each one of us. The voice of our inner man sounds like the Holy Spirit. Scripture provides us with His voice indicators in Galatians 5:22-23 when it talks about the fruit of the Spirit. The voice of God is loving, it is joyous, it is peaceful, it is so patient, full of kindness, edifying in its goodness, extremely faithful to our identity in Jesus, and it is full of gentleness. That is the voice that you should be listening to. All those aspects of that voice empower us to live in self-control where we partner with the new self against the old self.  
	Our new nature with its new voice takes control over the old self and the stress that it provokes. There is only one voice to hear, and it is the voice that makes you feel good about yourself, it makes you feel good to be alive in Jesus.  
	I was talking to a guy who was bitter and resentful at being fired from his job. He went on for ten minutes about how they betrayed him and this, that, and the other, and how he felt, and "I am too old to get the kind of job that I really need, and really want. I may never work again," and all this angst, and bitterness, and resentment.   
	So I said, "Okay, I have a question for you. What does the lordship of Jesus mean to you right now? Because it seems to me that the lordship of Jesus matters on days like this. He is not just around for the good stuff. He is doubly around for the stuff that would knock your head sideways. What does the lordship of Jesus mean for you right now?"   
	"Here is my observation on your circumstances. What if you didn't get fired? What if God released you from a job that you would never have left so that you could do something better?"   
	That is remodeling\!  
	He said, "What do you mean?"  
	I said, "Well, did you like the job that you had?"  
	"Well, not really."  
	"Were you fulfilled in that job?"  
	"No\!"  
	"Well, dude, what are you so mad about? God has released you from a job that you didn't like to do, to do something that you would like to do. Perhaps you'd like to think about that?"  
	It is interesting, eh? I sometimes feel that most Christians studied at the University of Weird.  
	There is a difference between "state" and "standing." Your state is how you see yourself outside of Christ. We see ourselves often as weak, powerless, incapable, inadequate, victims, and so on. Your standing is who you are in Christ in your truest identity. You are strong. You are powerful. You are favored . You are accepted. You are beloved. You are anointed. State, and standing.  
	In our state, our emotions are overwhelmed by negativity. They get caught up in those mental filters through which we look at our world.   
	In our standing the passion of Jesus for us empowers our emotions as we understand how He thinks of us. So joy and rejoicing are on the menu 24/7, even in your sleep. Shakespeare said, "There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so."   
	In Christ we are aligned with the Father's perception of Jesus in us. I love the fact that everything comes to us because all of Heaven is attracted to Jesus in you. Everything comes to the Christ in you. The best place in the world to stand is in this grace in which we stand in Christ. Heaven is attracted to us. The Kingdom wraps around us, and all the permissions of God are 'Yes' and 'Amen' in Jesus. In Christ we keep all our thinking inside the boundaries of God's love, His grace, His kindness, and His mercy so that we are empowered by His goodness towards us, so that in Jesus our emotions come from a heart of rejoicing, thanksgiving, and gratitude. All of our emotions should be touched by joy.   
	I always find it interesting that people get mad when people start laughing in church. They get offended, which is fascinating to me because they say, "Oh, it's emotionalism." What about all the people who come with their misery, with their fear, with their anxiety, with their worry, with their panic? Nobody accuses them of being emotional\! So what is it that makes misery acceptable but joy unacceptable? That is the University of Weird right there\! That doesn't make a lick of sense to anybody, and now you have realized it you are thinking, "I'm not brining my misery to church anymore\!"  
	I love the way God looks at things.   
	Here's the thing: We do not allow our beliefs to be challenged by our circumstances. We allow them to be strengthened. What if all your circumstances are really a source of strength to you, whether they are good, bad, or ugly? What if God is using a bad situation to strengthen your belief? Wouldn't that be just like Him, that on His agenda is, "I am allowing this because I really want to strengthen who you are. I want to teach you a little bit of patience and perseverance. It will be cool. Just stay close to Me and don't panic\!"  
	We challenge our circumstances by what we believe about who God is for us. So you can flat out get in the face of your circumstances and say, "Listen, this is who I am. This is who God is for me. This is what I am doing. I am about to start rejoicing. You may not want to stick around, but this is who I really am. This is my true identity, and this circumstance is going to make me a better person, and it is going to deliver me an upgrade\!" We are not used by our circumstances, we use them.   
	It would be a real blessing to Heaven if you stopped trying to stir up your old self to rejoice. Trust me, your angel will kiss you. Your new nature can't help but rejoice. Sometimes if you are in a meeting and you don't feel like it, it is a clear indication you are in the wrong place. You are in the wrong identity because your new nature loves to rejoice. Your new nature adores Jesus and can't wait to bless Him. If you are in a meeting, "I don't really feel like worshiping... (tired voice)" that is your old nature talking to you, and you don't talk back; you just ignore it, just step into your new nature. Stop trying to stir up your old self to rejoice.  
	If you are going to learn the power of rejoicing, then you must let go of being upset, anxious, tired, and feeling down. Let it go\! Put it away from you. Lay aside the old self and put on the new self. Rejoicing is an act of the will. It is not an act of the emotion. God works in you both to will and to do. The key thing for us is that we are always handing over our will to the Lord. Phil. 2:13, *God works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.*   
	Changing your mindset is the best way to handle a negative. Don't argue with negativity. Ignore it\! Change your mindset, "Well, I'm not thinking that. I am going to think something better." You can only replace a mindset with a mindset.   
	Here's the thing, though: You have got to step forcefully into the mind of Christ and ask different questions of the Holy Spirit, who loves questions anyway. We must never tolerate a divided self. You have to decide who you are going to be in the Spirit, and then realize all your life circumstances are to strengthen that identity. Don't engage with a negative, put on the new.  
	Let me read you something else from the Bible. Eph. 4:20, *But you didn't learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught Him just as truth is in Jesus, that in reference to your former manner of life you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and you put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.* Col. 3:9, *Do not lie to one another since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created Him.*  
	You don't deal with the old self, you set it aside. We are not pastoring a corpse. We are not counseling our old nature. We are discipling our real nature, our true nature in Jesus. Lay aside the old self, don't work on it. Be renewed in the spirit of your mind. Pay attention to who Jesus is for you because that is where your freedom lies. Put on the new self, which is in the likeness of God and righteousness will flow, and holiness of the truth will be a part, and a fixture in your life.   
	We don't have a sin problem. We have a problem with beauty and majesty. We don't realize how beautiful we are to God and how majestic His love is towards us. Your new self will tell you all that stuff. Your new self glories in Jesus.  
	I think our old nature is confused by God. The natural mind can't understand the things of the Spirit. It is confusing. God is not the author of confusion. We are. When we step out of our placement in Christ, all our receptors become invalid. We become confused when His truth clashes with what is inauthentic about the Christ-life in our experience.  
	Let me read you something else from the Bible. Gal. 2:20, *I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live.* (Thank God\!) *I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave Himself up for me.* There it is, black and white, it is in the Bible. You are dead, shut up\! And when I say "shut up" I say it in the sweetest possible way because we encourage our new nature to talk, but the old nature, it's like, "Shut up\! Uh-uh, shut up\!"  
	Life in Christ reflects the place where He lives and where we live in Him. Our vision of ourselves is always upgraded in Jesus. It is a little like having a first class ticket on a plane but choosing to travel in coach. It is not Bible-believing to be listening to your old voice, your old self. You are a new creation, the old self is dead. *Reckon yourself to be dead to sin but alive to God.* Practice being alive to God in your thinking. You have a first class ticket in Jesus. Don't sit in coach or we'll send Sarge after you. He will sort you out\! Have you met Sarge yet? You need to meet Sarge. He will sort you out because He is a lover of Jesus, and a lover of the true place to live from.   
	That is your identity. I am a lover of the real place of connection in Jesus, and I am not settling for an inferior way of thinking when I want to think like Him. I want to think about myself the way that God thinks about me.   
	We are in Christ. When we are weak, we are strong. Why? Because He has a way of coming into weakness and making it feel brilliant. When we feel inadequate, we can do all things in Christ. Why? Because Jesus has a way of coming into an inadequacy and turning it right around. When we are reviled for His name, we are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us.  
	So you need to be asking, "Lord, can I just have a few more people to revile me?" Fortunately I don't have to pray that prayer. My hate mail is substantial. All my hate mail has taught me to dance, which I am not going to do right now. It's like I read a piece of hate mail, I don't get down by it because my question is, "Okay, (I am reading it out to the Lord) this is what it said. Can I be blessed because of that? Can I have a little bit more glory because of that? Can you just rest upon me right now?" I am using it\!  
	You always are declaring who you are. We need to quit declaring who we are not. Declare who we are in Jesus; that's brilliant thinking.   
	In October 2009 I contracted a brain virus, and I am still dealing with some of the after-effects of that. This weekend is my payback\! Here is my position when I was on the floor with this thing for a few months. This is the place where I chose to make my stand in terms of fighting back. I would declare to the enemy, "I am not battling with this condition. I am surrendering to a power in Christ I have never known before. I am not a sick person trying to get well. I am a whole person fighting off sickness."  
	That for me, every single day, was my space before the Lord. "This is who I am," and every day (I think I am on day 300-and-something) I am presenting myself to the Lord. I mean, it's brilliant. Every morning it's like, "Ta-da\! Here I am.” Just presenting myself for healing saying, "Lord, this is my position. It is my pleasure to ask and keep on asking knowing that it will be given."  
	Behavior is the echo of belief. The new man never sees a negative because it is too involved with Jesus. This is our joy in the earth to be absolutely intrigued and involved with the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are not intimidated by the enemy or circumstances because we are too busy being fascinated by the Lord Jesus Christ.   
	Our problem on days is that we allow our circumstances to be bigger than our blessing. Beloved, that is just not right. That is not Kingdom. That is not the sound of Heaven. In Christ, the truth is the bigger the circumstances, the greater the provision. Caleb was excited not just that there were a few giants, but there were a lot of them. He was excited by that\! "This is cool\! There are so many giants. Sheesh\! We are going to be amazing\!" Big promises require huge provisions. We have all got promises in our life. We need to cash them in.  
	Under pressure, our old nature defaults to resistance, to anger, to fear, to anxiety, to tiredness, to depression, to distress. But our new nature is always redefined in every situation. Your new nature looks at something and says, "Oh my goodness\! By the time we get through this, I am going to be astonishing\!" Our new nature looks at a problem and says, "Dear Lord, thank You\! I mean, sheesh. The provision around this problem has got to be really tasty\! And it's not even my birthday\!"  
	Here's the thing: The issue that is in front of us that is demanding our attention is never the issue from God. That is the issue the enemy wants you to handle, but behind that issue is the real issue. Every single situation, and problem, and adversity, and difficulty, and persecution, or whatever in your life is always about one thing and one thing only: It is about your relationship with God. Every single circumstance you have is only ever about your relationship with God. That is the first thing on God's agenda because His purpose in sending Christ was to bring many sons into glory. The number one purpose of God in your life is to make you Christ-like. Therefore, every situation, every circumstance, that is the agenda of God for you so it has to become your agenda. Most of the time we look at those situations and we want them to be resolved so we engage with the situation before we have really engaged with who God is for us. We start to pray, "Lord, help me with this, and help me with that," and we are engaging with the situation that the enemy wants you to engage with\! But God wants you to engage with your identity in Christ first.   
	The first issue is always relational because every single thing that God is doing in your life is relational, it is to upgrade who you are in the Lord Jesus. The first response, therefore, is to first upgrade your relationship with God in Christ so the question is, "Lord, what does this situation mean for our relationship?" I want to have an upgrade in relationship first because if I upgrade my relationship with Christ as my priority, very often the situation sorts itself out. But if it doesn't, you are facing it in the best possible way.   
	If it doesn't sort itself out, it is because God has another upgrade that you didn't see in the first place. Any situations that are intractable, it is because God has more to give you than you imagined. So sometimes a situation may take a month or six weeks, or six months, and really the reason it takes longer is because God wants to give you more. But He also wants to teach you how to rejoice, and how to give thanks, and how to be at peace, and how to live from a place of patience because that really annoys the enemy\!   
	What you are learning, too, is that the fruit of the Spirit is a more powerful weapon against the enemy than the gifts, that you can beat the enemy by staying in the love of God, that you can depress him by being patient because he lost all of that when he fell from Heaven. He had access to all of that in Heaven; when he fell from Heaven, he fell into impatience. He has no patience whatsoever. He doesn't want you to have any either. You can beat the enemy by being patient. You can depress him with your joy. You can weary him with your rest, and your kindness, and your gentleness. You can totally dispirit him with the goodness of God because he has no access to any of that, and he doesn't know how to fight it. He can't fight against God; he is hopeless.   
	Holy Spirit never lost a fight yet\!  
	The only thing the enemy can do is make you like him, anxious, fearful, worried. He is all those things. Resentful, bitter, angry, judgmental, unkind. All he can do is make you like him.   
	The purpose of the Holy Spirit is to make you like Jesus. Everything in your life is relational, and the relational issue is the key. Get your upgrade in terms of your relationship with God and very often the whole situation will get reordered in your thinking, and you will find a way of working through that thing and picking up some upgrades on the way.  
	So under negative pressure we can default to a prior behavior that is rooted in low self esteem or bad habits. Alternatively, we can use the situation to define who we are in Christ and establish that as a fact in our lifestyle with new habits.  When we come under pressure in that area again, we don't default to a sin habit, we just press the reset button, and we default to who we are in Jesus. We have learned our lesson. We have our upgrade; I am not letting go of it. I have translated it from an experience into a lifestyle.  
	God is devoted to changing the way that you think so that your lifestyle can actually cultivate His affection for you.   
	When you believe a lie, you empower the liar. Here is my two-word counseling ministry: STOP IT\! Could you just stop opposing God with your own thoughts and learn how to have your thoughts in alignment with who He is for you? That is why Jesus said, "Hey\! Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world, which means I have overcome all the negativity. Everything that is against you in the world, I have overcome it. Cheer up\!"  
	I was at a dinner party with some friends and strangers. It was a European style meal, sixteen people, an oblong table. At each course you move two places to the left so you end up having talked to everybody during the course of the meal. It's brilliant. So we had six courses, and it's going to take us three or four hours. I was in one of these types of meals, which is what I've grown up in, and I was talking to a woman who had just got her dream job. She was really excited, you know, ideal company, great pay, brilliant reputation, great training package. So excited, worked all her life to get this kind of job.  
	And I said, "Wow\! You must be delighted\!"  
	And then she said to me, "Well, actually, I'm extremely fearful. I feel sick. I feel anxious. I feel paranoid that I won't be good enough. I have had a fear of failure all my life."  
	You could see it etched on her face, "I am extremely fearful."   
	So I said, "Huh. But what if you are not? What if you are not extremely fearful? What if you are just apprehensive? That's normal, right? New job, new people. It is normal to be apprehensive, "Will you fit in?" all that kind of stuff. What if you are not extremely fearful. What if you are just apprehensive?"  
	And she thought about it, you know, intelligent woman. She is sitting there. She is thinking about it. She is going, "Hmm. Yeah\! Yeah, you know what? That's right. Yeah. I'm apprehensive. Yeah, it's okay to be apprehensive. Ah, thanks\! I'm really glad I talked to you about it."  
	I said, "So, you are apprehensive."  
	She said, "Yeah."  
	I said, "Well, what if you are not? What if you are a little anxious, but you are also intrigued?"  
	She said, "What do you mean?"  
	I said, "It's a great company, right? You said so yourself. These are professional people. They are not idiots. They must have seen something in you that they thought was worthy of giving you the job. They must be excited about you joining the company\! Great training, great support. Everything is right there for you. So, you know, sounds great to me. So what if, really, you know, you are just a little anxious, but you are really intrigued about what God is going to do?"  
	And she went, "Hah, wow\! Yeah, it is a great company, and you are right. They are the best of the best. They are first in their field, and they wouldn't appoint an idiot. Yeah, they must have seen something in me. Yeah\! And a little anxiety is okay. Yeah, but I am really intrigued now."  
	So I said, "So you are just a little anxious, but mostly intrigued?"  
	She said, "Yeah, I think so."  
	I said, "Cool\! What if you are not? What if you are mildly nervous, but really excited? It's your dream job. God was with you in the interview so He is going to be with you in the job. It's His dream job, too. It is the one that He has wanted to give you. It is the one that He has been working in all your training and development, and your employment history. He has been pushing you towards this place. This is His dream job as well\! He is really excited\! So you have His promise to you in the circumstances, so you can be excited about what God will do for you. What if you are just mildly nervous, but really excited?"  
	And now she is like hopping up and down on her seat saying, "Yeah\! I don 't know what I was thinking\! I almost never think like this. This is amazing\! I am so glad I talked to you. Yeah, I see it\! I get it\! I am mildly nervous. I am really excited about this job. I can't wait to start\!"  
	I said, "So you are mildly nervous, and you are really excited?  
	She said, "Yeah\!"  
	I said, "But what if you are not? What if you are quietly confident and really joyful? God has proved His presence, right? He has proved His presence at the interview. This is His dream job. He has given you an ideal company to work for that absolutely brings out the best that He sees in you. What if He is quietly confident in His own ability to make you astonishing, and what if He is really joyful about the prospect of doing so?"  
	And she sat there and she looks at me, and she smiles, and her whole face changed. She said, "Yeah. That is going to be my identity from now on. Confidence with joy, that's the new me."  
	Seventeen minutes is all it took to move her from "extremely fearful" to   
"Confidence with joy, that's the new me." Seventeen minutes. That is the art of thinking brilliantly. That is the mind of Christ. That is what it means about being renewed in the spirit of your mind. Seventeen minutes.  
	Thankfully we were having dessert so my food didn't go cold\!   
	Seventeen minutes to totally remodel someone's thinking, and someone's emotions, and someone's perceptions of herself in line with who God is. That is my world record right now\!  
	Question , then. What would you do if you had no fear? What would your life be like if you had no fear? What would you attempt for God if you knew you couldn't fail? What would you plan to do if you were convinced that God would resource you? What would your approach be to setbacks and challenges if you were empowered by God's faithfulness?  
	This is a question God asked me three years ago. We are still having a conversation. "Graham, what would it mean for you to believe that I am unceasingly magnificent towards you?"  
	My first response was, "A new brain." I kind of think the brain virus got me a new brain. I need to be careful about being witty in my responses\!  
	That is the mind of Christ. Nothing negative, only positive the way that He thinks. He is remodeling your mindset. He is remodeling the way you think, the way you perceive your life, your circumstances. He is giving you different language, and He is saying to you, "You can't think this thing from the old self. You need to make a decision about which self you are going to listen to."  
	How many of us, when something happens, our first thought is a negative, our first speculative look at something is pessimistic, "Oh, I knew this would happen." How many of us find it difficult to see beyond the problem? Or we are always finding ourselves overwhelmed by doubt or fear? That is your old self talking.   
	Beloved, your old self is dead. It has no voice. Listen to who you really are, and listen to the voice of your permissions. The new self in Christ is being raised up so that you can occupy your circumstances completely differently.  
	Let's pray.

	Father, I thank You. I want to thank You, Lord, that this is a whole new day. It is a whole new day.  
	I was flying from Sydney to San Francisco, and it's that part of the flight where everyone is asleep and all the lights are off, and there are just a few of us awake, and I had my light on and I'm reading, and the pilot comes on the intercom and he said, "Well, we just crossed the international dateline so whether you like it or not, or appreciate it or not, this is a whole new day. This is a brand new day, enjoy it\!" And that was it, and I'm thinking, "Oh my Lord, Quantas has prophets\!"  
	In Australia, prophets fly planes for Quantas\!  
	Beloved, this is a whole new day. We are learning something here, a way of being, a way of seeing, a way of thinking, a way of living with God that absolutely releases joy and thanksgiving, and gratitude, and causes us to rise up in every situation because we are starting to understand just who we really are in Jesus.  
	So, Father, I want to ask You right now, Lord, that You set aside this day, this very day, to upgrade our thinking to a level it has never been at in our whole life. I want to pray, Lord, that we would all be quietly joyfully confident. This is my time to be renewed in the spirit of my mind, to take on board the mind of Christ, and to learn the joy and the art of thinking in a completely different way. Thank You, Lord, that You are remodeling the way that I think, and You are remodeling my heart and my mind to be in sync with the mind of Christ. So this is a good day\!  
	Lord, I ask You to bless us with the right war in our current circumstances, that we fight the way You want us to fight, quietly, confidently, and with joy, that we will love the situations we are in because we are about to see the upgrade that actually is present, and the enormity of what You are doing in our lives, and that You are going to use my current circumstances to upgrade me, to increase me, to multiply me, and to make me like Jesus because everything, but everything, but everything is relational.   
	So, Holy Spirit, would You continue doing a number on us while we slurp some coffee, and chat? For Jesus' sake, amen.

Disc 3

	This session we are going to look at the law of life in Christ Jesus so I am going to read the Bible. This is one of the things I like to do in my own devotional times. I love to read the Bible to the Father. I stand up and say, "Listen to this. You wrote this. Do you remember this piece? 2 Cor. 5:16, *Therefore, from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh.* That Greek word for "no one" means "no one." *Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh yet now we know Him in this way no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature. The old thing is passed away. Behold new things have come. Now all these things are from God who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. Namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ as though God were making an appeal through us. We beg you, on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.*  
	We are a new creation. All the old things have passed away. Everything is from God. As I said earlier, we are a race of people never seen before Jesus, but now we are visible in a post-redemption time. The whole earth is getting to see the glory of God in the sons of God. The whole earth is waiting, travailing for the appearance of the sons of God. That is you and I. The earth demands that we come forth in our true identity. Our communities, our societies, our civilization is demanding that we come forth and take our rightful place in the earth.  
	Here's the thing: The Old Testament was a visitation culture. God came on people for a purpose. The New Testament is a habitation culture where the principle intention is to form Christ in us and empower us to abide in the presence of God. So you have the presence of God with you. Just nudge your neighbor and say, "You are in the Presence. You are totally in the Presence\!"   
	The intention of God is that we have an ongoing encounter with Him that is rooted in Christ in us, the expectation of glory. We expect something brilliant to happen because Christ is within us. He is with us. He is in us. We are abiding in His presence. Christ within is the central pillar of our relationship with the Father.  
	We have to lose this whole visitation focus. You are a walking habitation. You have Christ on the inside so we are not praying, "Holy Spirit, come," we are thanking Him that He is here. We are proclaiming His presence. We are a people of proclamation. We are in the presence of God.   
	One of the key questions in the New Testament is, "How do you seek the Lord when He never leaves you nor forsakes you?" That is a great question\! What it means is you seek Him with joy and delight in every single situation that you encounter because He is in this thing with me. It's like you say to yourself, "It's impossible for me to have a situation where God is not present."   
	So my first thing when I get a situation is I am going to look for the presence of Jesus, and I am going to stand where He is standing, and then we are going to have a conversation. I am looking for the presence of God. I am looking for the reality of God. I am seeking that reality because Christ is in me, therefore, He is in the situation so I am looking for His presence in that particular circumstance. I want to find Him in the way that He wants to be found.   
	The reason you get lots of different circumstances is because God wants to pop up differently in your life so He has given you loads of opportunity. Some situations will be about developing patience. He will be your patience. Some will be about you developing peace. He will be the Prince of Peace. He wants to be for you exactly what you need in that situation so in every situation you are seeking, "What is it You want to be for me now that You couldn't be at any other time?" That is one of my all-time favorite questions because we are intrigued. We know He is here. How does He want to be here in this particular situation?   
	I was walking down a corridor in a church when I lived in England. You go through doors at one end, and there is this corridor in front of you, and you are walking down it, and the doors open at the other end, and a person that you don't really want to talk to starts walking towards you. Have you ever had that feeling? It's like a sense of impending doom, and you realize you can't just avert your eyes or anything, so I looked at her and I said, "Hey, so how are you doing? How is it going?"  
	She stopped and she said, "I have cancer. I have just come from the doctors. I have cancer."  
	Bad boy, me, I was just thinking, "Going to be late for my meeting\!" Like a meeting is more important than someone with cancer. What was I thinking? Idiot.  
	She said, "I have cancer. I have six months to live," and she looked at me and she said, "You and I have never gotten along, but I need you right now."  
	I said, "Sweetie, I am here."  
	She looked at me and she said, "Tell me the truth. Will I live or die?"  
	I just laughed. I said, "I can't tell you that\! But I can help you find a way through to discovering who God is."  
	She went, "Okay."  
	"And then He will give you the answer to that question."  
	She said, "What do I do?"  
	I said, "You ask the Holy Spirit this question, 'What is it that You want to be for me now that I have cancer that You couldn't be at any other time?' You ask that question several times a day, and He will connect with you." Then I prayed with her.  
	About ten days later, I see her in the building, and I said, "How are you doing?"  
	She said, "I got my answer." She said, "That was a great question. I kept asking it every fifteen minutes, 'Lord, what is it You want to be?' and every time I asked it, a certainty grew in my heart that He wanted to be something for me. For two or three days I lost sight of the fact that I had cancer because I was so excited about what God was going to be for me. In the night, five or six days afterwards, I woke up and I heard these words, 'I am the Lord that heals you.'  
	She is cancer-free\!  
	It's a great question, "What is it You want to be for me now that You couldn't be at any other time?" That's a great question. Love that.  
	The focal point of our concentration is on the indwelling Jesus and learning how to abide in Him, how to stay. We live in a habitation culture. John 14:23, *If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word and My Father and I will love him, and We will come and make Our abode with him.* 1 John 2:24 talks about taking up residence and God staying with us permanently. *Abide in Me and I will abide in you. If you abide in Me and My word abides in you, you can ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. Abide in My love.* John 15\.  
	To abide means to stay in a given place of relationship and expectancy. Abide. We don't abide casually. We abide with focus. We abide with passion. We abide in a sense of expectancy. Romans 8:9-11 says, *The Spirit of God dwells in you, and He quickens you.* He speeds up your development. You are a temple of the living God, and the Spirit dwells in you, 1 Cor. 3:16. To abide means to occupy, to indwell, to live together intimately.  
	We are a temple of the living God and He has said, *I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people*, 2 Cor. 6:16.  
He guards our hearts and our minds. He guards us through the indwelling Holy Spirit and the treasure that has been released to you. Every one of us has treasure, and the Holy Spirit is teaching us to abide so that the treasure can be seen and can be spent on somebody else as well as ourselves.  
	We are being built together as a habitation of God in the Spirit, Eph. 2:22. *By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us because He has given us His Spirit,* 1 John 4:13. You are a habitation of God. He is not an uncle. He is not going to come and visit you. He came in and He came to stay. He ain't leaving, so somewhere along the line we are going to have to get used to the fact that my life is all about habitation.   
	I have never understood the whole desperate for God thing. I am not desperate for God. I am too busy enjoying who He is for me. Desperate for God like I am missing something? I am discovering something almost every day. I enjoy where I am with God.  
	We are a habitation of God in the Spirit. There is something to be discovered and to be explored every day of our lives. Our whole culture, our whole mindset, encounter, our experiences, our perspectives are based on habitation, not visitation. Because God is with me, I can do all things in Christ. Because God is with me, He can strengthen me even on days when I feel weak.   
	The law of life in Christ is that *as He is, so are we in this world*. The law of life in Christ says you have died and your life is now hidden with Christ in God, Col. 3:3. The law of life in the Spirit of Christ is *it is no longer I that lives, but Christ who lives in me.* The law of life in the Spirit of Christ is *Christ in you, the full expectation of glory.*   
	In Jesus we are joyfully submitted to His values, to the values and the principles of Heaven. You are under a rule, you are under government from a different dimension. Whatever His life touches must bow to His authority. We are getting used to the authority coming through us at any given moment. When we say, "Come, Holy Spirit," we are not inviting Him because He is missing. What we are doing when we say "Come, Holy Spirit," is we are inviting Him to take control of our circumstances.  
	The law of life in Christ Jesus is always in agreement with the Father. So, guys, no more visitation. You don't have visitation rights with Jesus\! This is not prison. Instead, as we learn how to abide in Him there is this vibrant partnership that emerges based on a lifestyle of continuous fellowship, and this is critical because it changes everything. Your perspective changes everything about who you are, about how you see things, about how you engage with the Kingdom of darkness, how you engage with the world, how you engage with people and situations that you are facing. It changes everything. God is with me, what really is the problem?   
	I am discovering who God is for me, what He wants to be for me now in these circumstances.   
	Many believers, I am convinced, are trying to experience the Kingdom from an Old Testament paradigm of visitation. I have been in so many prayer meetings where people have said, "Oh that You would rend the Heavens and come down\!" Well, I thought He already did that. I mean, He did it at the baptism of Jesus. You know, the Father loves to connect with Christ in you. At the baptism of Jesus the heaven opens, the Holy Spirit descends in bodily form, and God says, "That's My Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased\!' and you are in Him, so there is something about you that is pleasing to God. You are in Christ. You should enjoy that.  
	At the cross, in Matthew 27, when Jesus yielded up His Spirit, the whole veil of the temple was rent, torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook, and rocks split, and now we can enter that veil with a sure and steadfast hope. We have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus. Can anything separate us from the living God? No. So let's not live like we are an egg white or something, separated out. When Jesus said, *Take my yoke upon you* He wasn't thinking about that\!   
	Come on, you knew it was coming\! I know, it's a complete debacle, but there you go.  
	We enter that veil by a new and living way. That new and living way is habitation and abiding. You are in a habitation culture. It is in you. God is in you; He is not leaving. We must not just get used to that, we must start to trade on that because we live like God is not there, or like we have to persuade Him to show up. What's that about? You can't have a habitation encounter with God at salvation and then downgrade it to a visitation culture in your experience. Not only is that really bad hermeneutics, it's just disgraceful, and I say that sweetly. Guys, that is not us\! It is not who we are. We are a habitation of God. We are a 'Yahoo\!' people\! We have the joy of the Lord. We have the peace that passes all understanding. We are absolutely beloved of God. We are accepted in the Beloved. We have the mind of Christ. Our only problem is we don't quite realize how brilliant we are yet\! But we are getting there. We are on that road. We are learning to grow up in all things in Jesus.   
	Here's the thing: We are governed by the same law of life in the Spirit that Jesus was governed by when He was on earth, and in which He still gladly abides  in Heaven. He would say, *I only do what the Father is doing, and I only say what the Father is saying.* What does that mean? It means in every situation He said to the Father, "So how do You see this? What are You saying about this?"   
	We are a prophetic people because the Jesus who lives in us is prophet, priest, and king, and we have the Holy Spirit who is the Spirit of disclosure. He will take the things that are to come and declare them to you. We have a prophetic anointing. It is relational, and some of us have it relationally and ministerially. But we all have it relationally.   
	We all can see into the future because God is with us, and we are learning to be present-future. So here I am in the present. I really like where I am, and I love this journey that I am on, and I am learning how to walk down that road with God and have confidence, and walk it joyfully, no matter what is down there because I know that every crisis on that road has a provision, and an encounter, and an upgrade in Christ. There is no trepedation in our hearts. We are a people of habitation and, therefore, maximum expectation. It doesn't matter for us what is down there because we don't travel with fear. Perfect love has cast it out. So I like this journey that I am on, and even if there are going to be some crises and trauma, I can trust the Lord that He has made provision for me on those days so when I get there, there will be a provision waiting for me.   
	God often gives us words about the future. That is because He wants to make sure we know we have one. So He gives you a word, and if it doesn't make sense where you are in the present, then it is not for now, it is for then and you understand it when you get there. You walk down the road and something happens, and you realize, "Hang on a minute\! This is what God was talking about two years ago\!" The beauty about habitation and your present-future existence with God is He is always previous. I wonder how many things we are going through right now that God has talked about a couple years ago? We should check out our promises, check out our prophecies. When God gives you a promise or a prophecy, it is to get you moving from the present towards your future, and then here He is. He doesn't stop there, though. He doesn't just give you a word that says, "Walk this way." You are present-future, He is future-present. That means He starts walking from the future into your present. Somewhere along the line you are going to connect, so  when God says this word could happen in ten years, it is an arbitrary thing. What He is saying is, "Don't forget I will be walking towards you, and when we connect, that thing is going to explode," and it might be two years from now because God is a quickening Spirit. He loves to speed things up. What you think will take years could take months. What you think could take months could take weeks. What you think could take weeks could happen in hours or moments. I believe there will come a day before Jesus comes back when prophetically something prophesied in the morning will be fulfilled in the afternoon of the same day, and we will all be living in the "This is that" culture, "This is that which God said to me."   
	Everything I am doing these days was prophesied in the 1970s. I am living in the unfolding of about half a dozen prophetic words at work in my life right now. I can't get out of bed in the morning without knowing that something I am doing today was prophetically inspired three decades ago. "This is that" is a really powerful place to live.  
	We are governed by the same law that Jesus was governed by. You only do what the Father is doing, and you only say what He is saying. What is He saying right now? What is it He wants you to do right now? That comes out of your place of habitation. There is no fear for us. There is no uncertainty for us. There is a quiet confidence. There is a joy. God has preceded this situation. He may have preceded it with a word, but before I get into that situation, He is already there plotting something wonderful because He is wonderful, and everything He does is good.   
	Jesus manifested a Heaven-to-earth lifestyle in His perspective. He walked with God. He knew His presence constantly. He practiced abiding and ministered the truth out of it. We can do nothing to enter this place with God. It is a gift. But we must do everything to stay there, and that is what abiding is. It is the discipline of staying, and dwelling, and remaining.   
	When I talk about discipline, never think of discipline as a hard thing because it is not. Every discipline is rooted in delight and desire. The one thing I know is that 6.3 billion people on the planet are going to want to do their own thing. Everyone will do exactly what they want to do. It is in our DNA to operate out of delight and desire. We all have passions that we love to do. What discipline is rooted in a passion?  
	I was talking to a guy in Dallas and he said, "Well, I just really can't crack the discipline of prayer."  
	I said, "Why did you make it a discipline in the first place? All discipline is rooted in desire. You shouldn't be asking the Lord to give you the discipline of prayer, you should ask Him to give you the delight of praying. Ask Him for passion. If you are going to ask Him for anything, ask for passion. 'Give me a passion to pray\! Give me a passion for the lost\! Give me a passion for the prophetic,' whatever it might be. "Lord, give me a passion for this," because He is extremely passionate about everything.   
	Jesus' passion was, "I only do what the Father is doing. My meat and My drink is to do the will of Him who sent Me." It was His life force.  
	Salvation is God's gift to us. Abiding is our response to Him. We have been placed in Christ, and it is our pleasure to remain there and to dwell in continuing presence. We partner with the Holy Spirit in dwelling and remaining always in the Lord Jesus. We are seated with Him in heavenly places, which means our perspectives are all drawn from another dimension other than this world.   
	You are supposed to be having experiences that are out of this world. Tragically, I think a lot of Christians have a visitation culture so they are more likely to have an out-of-body experience because they stop going to church, than an out-of-this-world experience because they are living life from a different dimension.  
	This is the session of bad jokes\!  
	"Seated with Him in heavenly places," what does that mean? It means that we have an ascended lifestyle. You have to know He wants to elevate you up out of your circumstance and put your thinking, and your heart, and your perspective in a completely different place above the issue, above the problem, above the opposition, above the persecution. We are not subject to the world's way of thinking, seeing, and doing. We operate from a different dimension through co-habiting with Jesus.   
	All of Heaven is focused on your identity in Christ. When we abide, we get to align our whole life with His perception of us. The first place of freedom is always the renewal of your thinking. Transformation comes by the renewing of the mind, Romans 12, so how you think creates the place of breakthrough in your life. If you are thinking from a visitation perspective, you are looking for God in the wrong places. If you think from a habitation perspective, you are going to see Him everywhere because you are always looking for Him. You walk into a different place, you are looking for Jesus. You encounter a circumstance, you are looking for Jesus. Something happens, you are looking for where Jesus is standing. You are looking to locate Him and just be with Him.   
	We are learning to seek the Lord, and He makes sure that we find Him. *If you seek Me, I will make sure that you find Me.* What He is saying is, "You are in a habitation place, just keep looking. I will be the one smiling and waving\! That will be Me."   
	The habitation perspective gives you new language that is based upon a reality of Christ within. We are learning to see everything He sees, and we are learning to agree with his mindset.   
	The law of life in Christ is always about permission because 2 Cor. 1:20 says that everything in Him is 'Yes' and 'Amen.' The law of life in Christ is about permission. That means that we have a green light until God turns it red so none of this, "Well, I'm just waiting for God to confirm." He already did. He said everything is 'Yes' and 'Amen' in Christ so go until God says 'No.' Don't be sat here waiting for God to say 'Yes,' go until He says 'No.' The light is green until He turns it red. So just go for it\! God is with you. You have permission. Everything is 'Yes' and 'Amen.' If He wants it to be a 'No,' He has to take responsibility for showing up and telling you. He is saying to you, "Everything is 'Yes,' get over your bad self\!" Everything is 'Yes,' permission is granted.  
	Don't live below the line of your privilege. You are a habitation of God. Everything flows to you from that reality. It is the law of life in Christ Jesus. Anything less is illegal and in Scripture is a poverty spirit. A poverty spirit is not about being financially oppressed. It is about living with meager possibilities, when in Christ, all things are possible.   
	We are living under a weight of majesty, and favor, and blessing, and promise, all of it wrapped up in Jesus because He is the author and finisher of our faith. We are learning to persist in who Jesus is for us.  
	I like persistence. Persistence means that you are not quitting on who you are in Christ. We are persevering in our identity because that guarantees our breakthrough. The enemy is always trying to take you out of your identity and, therefore, minimize your effectiveness. But the Holy Spirit is teaching you to abide in Christ because that reveals your inheritance. The longer you abide in Christ, the more you see of what God wants to give you, and so everything becomes a possibility to receive. We learn how to receive double when we are under pressure.  
	Persistence and perseverance are not disciplines, they are pleasures. They empower us to live above the line, not below it. When we see persistence and perseverance only as disciplines, we are convinced that we don't have it, and it will be hard to get. Every time we think of a discipline it's like, "Whew\!" (long sigh). We are not learning to persist in our circumstances, but we are learning how to persist in the beauty of God's nature in our situations.   
	So for me, four days before this brain virus struck, the Lord said to me, "I am taking you into a whole new place, a whole new domain of joy." Four days later, I am walking into the ER, and I tell you an old lady walking backwards with a Zimmer frame could have beaten me from the parking lot to the desk. Four days later I am struggling, feeling like I am having a stroke or something, and I am in the ER sat there in one of those really weird gowns that they put on people that leave you feeling exposed and stupid, and I can hardly answer all the questions. Theresa is having to answer or interpret my grunts. Then he gives me a spinal tap, which is not an interview with the band. So I am having a spinal tap, and I can barely talk. At this point I am thinking, "I am done with this\! So I threaten the enemy: You can take my voice, but I am going to ask the Lord for the anointing of my six favorite Christian authors of all time, and I am going to kick your butt all over the world in print. You see if I don't\!"  
	Then as I am coming to terms with this whole thing of, "What does it mean?" and "What is it You want to be for me?" suddenly this word of the Lord said to me, "Son, I am taking you to a whole new level of joy."  
	I am thinking, "Okay. Joy is my permission, then. I have permission to be joyful." So I began to pursue joy. Here's the thing for me: I am not persisting with a physical condition. I am not persisting in my circumstances. I am persisting with joy.   
	Do you understand the difference? I am persisting with joy; stuff my circumstances\! Couldn't care less\! Joy is what I am interested in. I am persisting in the art of being joyful so that means every day I am practicing being happy. Every day I want to wake up with a smile on my face. If I am having a really bad day, I want to phone some people up and tell them some really awful jokes. I am going to do something\! I am persisting with joy. I am persevering with the pleasure of God. I want to live every day under His smile.  
	In the Spirit we do not persist against something, we persist in Someone, so I am learning to remain in joy, and to persist in joy, and to be joyful each day, and to face everything with joy, and to learn the happiness of God in the trial that I am in. So I am going to count it all joy, every bit of it. I am counting it. I have joy here, I have joy there, I have some joy over there, and that is really joyful. This, brilliant\! I can't wait to get some joy in that\! I am counting everything as joy. I am counting on joy right now.  
	You guys are awfully quiet. You are getting on my last nerve right now\!  
	I am going to count everything as being joyful. Everything\! Hey, no golf claps please\! Jesus is worth celebrating\!  
	So what it means for me in my situation is I am counting the joy of everything. That is joyful, this is joyful, that is joyful, I am getting an upgrade of joy in that one, that is joyful, really looking forward to having some joy in that one; counting it all as joyful. *Count it all as joy.*  
	Col. 1:23 says, *Continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast and not moved away from your expectation of the Gospel.* That, in a nutshell, is abiding. Heb. 12:28 says,  *Since we have received a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us show gratitude by which we may offer to God acceptable service with reverence and awe.* Habitation culture means you are living in a Kingdom that can't be shaken. That means you can't be shaken.   
	What if there is a place in an ascended lifestyle with Jesus where you live above the situation so you are not controlled by the circumstances but by the experience of God that you are having in them? Do you want me to say that in English? I just slipped into Polish right there, right? I must have done\!  
	You are not controlled by the circumstances. You are controlled by the experience of God that you are having in them. That is your reality. You are persisting in the nature of who God is for you.   
	Perseverance is concerned with how to live joyfully in Christ above the circumstances. The Bible even talks about longsuffering with joy. It is great in the times when God is teaching you authority, every situation bows to you like that (fingers snapping)\! "I take authority over you," and BANG\! It's brilliant. Wonderful.  
	What happens, though, when He is teaching you patience? (Fingers snapping) When He is teaching you patience, your situation is going to be stretched out a little bit. Listen, the only reason God stretches you out is so He can push more in\! Every great Christian has stretch marks\! If a situation gets stretched out, God is wanting to put more in. There can't be any other reason than that, so you are learning how to persevere with who God is for you.  
	Perseverance is a place of delight and desire where we experience God's presence. Otherwise, we are going to grow weary instead of being refreshed.   
	Here's the thing in the Kingdom: The law of life in Christ Jesus will always cause you to overflow. Life in the Spirit is not meant to drain away from you. It is meant to bubble up and overflow constantly. John 4:14, *Whoever drinks of the water that I give him will never thirst.* That is so my goal\! Never thirst, always refreshed, always happy, always blessed no matter what is going on. That, to me, is real life in the Spirit. That is not a pipe dream. That is a reality of God for each one of us. That is why He put you into Christ so you could experience life on earth as Jesus knows it. The water that I give means he will never thirst. It will become in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. John 7:37-38, Jesus said, *I will give you rivers of living water.* Trust God, eh, like one river is not enough. No, our blessing has to be plural because it is exponential.  
	Here's the thing: What makes blessing plural is when you give it away. Then it comes back to you *pressed down, shaken together, and running over* if you engage with God. So as soon as you get a blessing in a situation that is difficult, find someone to give it away to. Call somebody up, give it away. Then the law of life in Christ Jesus is if you give it away, it has to come back multiplied.  
	We are learning to live a multiplied life. We are learning to live a life of increase and upgrade. It is the way that Jesus thinks and, therefore, it is the way that we think. Perseverance and persistence are about maintaining a Heaven-to-earth spirituality in the natural realm when everything is against us. It is the joy of constantly expressing your identity in the face of difficulty knowing that your identity will overcome because you are an overcomer. But God is not content in you being an overcomer. He wants to make you into more than a conqueror\!  
	What is more than a conqueror? More than a conqueror means the enemy doesn't show because it's not worth it. It's like he is on a tight budget because recession has really affected hell. It didn't affect Heaven whatsoever because God always owned everything. But the enemy right now is on a tight budget. Only God has abundance. The devil has a budget. He is on a tight budget, and we have a promise that the wealth of the wicked will be given to the righteous, so we are planning to squeeze his budget even more\! That is why he used intimidation because it is a cheap budget item in hell.  
	Goliath proved that. One guy has all of Israel's army corralled in their tent, in their camp hiding out with the baggage. One guy\! That is intimidation. It is the enemy using the least amount of resources to get the maximum amount of effect. The enemy is getting away with it right now because the church is a no-show. We don't show up for the fight. We don't want to live on the battleground between the clash of two kingdoms, and intimidation works until someone comes along who understands and is practicing intimacy. Your intimacy with God is the most intimidating thing about you. That is why you really must improve your rejoicing and your thanksgiving.   
	So Goliath is working, until Dave comes along with a few cheese sandwiches for his brothers. Then Goliath tries the same thing on Dave that he has tried with all the army of Israel, but it doesn't work on Dave because he is a man after God's own heart. He is in a whole different space. He is in a different heart space. He is in a different head space. David is the absolute master here at messing with the enemy's head\!   
	The enemy said, "I will feed your body to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field\!"  
	And David said, "I see that intimidation. I raise you 500\! I will deliver you and all your friends." What is he doing? He is messing with the enemy's head. Then David takes him out with what he has in his hand.   
	What you have in your hand is always going to be enough if Jesus is aiming the sling.  
	Then he stuns Goliath with a stone, but he kills him with Goliath's own sword so the very thing the enemy wants to use against you becomes a weapon in your hand to mess with the enemy's head. Then from that point on, everybody wants to see the head. Everything is about the head. He is walking down the road to Jerusalem and he has the head in a carrier bag. The streets are lined up with little kids going (in a high-pitched voice), "Dave, show us the head\!" Little grannies going (in a granny voice), "David, show us the head\!" Guys going (in a deep voice), "Dude, the head\!" He gets in the palace, and what is the first thing the king says? "Show me the head\! I want to see the head\!" That is messing with the enemy's head\!  
	What about that girl, Jael? Remember her? Canaanites fighting against Israel, and Deborah gives a prophecy to Barak, and she says that. "You will go out and you will have a great deliverance."  
	He says, "Well, can you all come with me?" He is a little bit nervous. You know, he has not heard my talk on "What if?"  
	She says, "I will go with you but the honor for this victory will go to a woman."  
	So in the end the Canaanite army gets routed and the commander, Sisera, is running away, and short story is he stops by Jael's tent. She says, "I will hide you," and while he is sleeping, she grabs a tent peg and a hammer and gives him a tense nervous headache\!  
	Here's the thing: Scripture says she banged that thing in until it went fast into the ground. She knocked that thing right through his head. Can you imagine being married to her? Suddenly it's like, "Darling, have you taken out the trash?"  
	"I'm just doing it, honey\!"  
	You have an argument at lunch time, and in the afternoon she comes into the room, and she has her hands behind her back, and you are nervous. It's like, "Sweetie, show me your hands\! What's behind your back?" You don't mess with that girl\!  
	You have the perfect right to mess with the enemy's head. Hey, listen\! He has been messing with yours long enough. This whole weekend is about us turning that whole thing around and saying to you, "Now it's your turn\!"  
	It's your turn to develop a way of thinking so amazing that it messes with the enemy's head and brings him to a place where he realizes, "Everything I try against this guy, against this girl, is not working. We can't afford to commit resources to a fight that we know we are going to lose," so he doesn't show. So you end up being more than a conqueror. Why? Because he doesn't show. You get onto that battlefield, and you are having a picnic because God lays a table in the presence of your enemies. So you are sat there eating fruit salad, and the enemy doesn't show. "Well, I'm just going to finish this cheesecake and if he is not here by then, I'm going."  
	The law of life in Christ is this: A promise elevates every circumstance. You need to find your promises. There are some things that God has promised you a while back, Scriptures that jumped off the page and almost hit you on the nose, prophecies that you know are about significance in the Spirit. Every one of those promises is designed to elevate a particular circumstance. You are a people of promise. God only deals with the language of promise. So what has He promised you? What promises are lying around your life that you have not claimed yet?  
	There are unclaimed upgrades all around this room. Some of you have upgrades stacked above your head. Some of you have so many upgrades God has had to open a storage depot in heaven just to stockpile your blessings. He would love to pour them out on you. His intention is to pour them out on you, but your intention to receive needs to match His intention to give.   
	When we live in a habitation culture, we are always positioned to receive. In Christ you learn where favor needs to connect with your circumstances, and you are looking for it. You have an expectation of that. The law of life in Christ is always concerned with God's intentional bias towards you. We are learning to live every day under His smile. He said, *I will lift up the light of My countenance upon you,* which is the best description of a smile I have ever heard. He is grinning at you. He is smiling at you. His eyes are bright towards you. He loves promises. He puts all His heart into them. He loves to help us receive under pressure. When promises are contested, it is only because God wants to give us more.   
	Everything the enemy does is an unconscious help towards the establishing of the Kingdom. That is why he hates himself. It is because one, it's not just that he can't avoid defeat, the other thing is he can't avoid helping us. There is only one Lord, and it's not the liar. So Christ is Lord in all things, over all things. Jesus uses all things. Everything is subject to Him. Every throne, every circumstance, everything is subject to Jesus. The enemy has to help us if we stand up in our habitation and say, "This situation is mine. This is what the Lord said to me. This is what the Lord wants to do, and you have to help." That's funny\!  
	The faithfulness of God is always the currency of heaven. It's like money in the bank. God is so committed to being faithful towards you. He is so committed to you becoming the man or the woman you are really supposed to be in everything.  
	When provision is the subject of warfare, the enemy will always challenge your provision. "Has God said?" So when provision is the subject of warfare, the promise is the object of Heaven. God says, "Yes, I gave you a promise. I am keeping My word." The promise is the objective of Heaven so we don't need to look at the provision or the circumstances. We look at the promise because God is not a man that He would lie. He gave you a word; that is His objectivity in your circumstances.  
	Your resources are embedded in the promise so, really, the promise is your weapon. Problems, difficulties, adversities, they are never the issue. Knowing how to overcome is the issue. Knowing how to receive under pressure is the issue. The key to overcoming is your own happiness, it is your own joy in the pleasure of God. *Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.* The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus is this: No weapon fashioned against you can prosper. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord.   
	You are a habitation. Visitation culture is at an end. We are declaring that is over. You are a habitation. The law of life in Christ Jesus works for you. God is with you. He is on your side. He is smiling on you. He loves who you are, and this is your moment to rise up and occupy. This is your moment to really realize the joy and the pleasure of persistence and perseverance in who God is. You are going to learn to overcome, and then you are going to learn how to become more than a conqueror. The enemy looks at you and realizes, "There just isn't any point. We can commit resources, but he is still going to win\! There is no point. Let's fight the battles we can fight and we can win. We can't win this one."  
	The enemy couldn't win against Caleb. When there was one last stronghold, all the giants were all praying, "Please don't let Caleb show\! Anyone but Caleb. Who's there? Is Caleb there? He is? Oh shoot\! Great\!" More than a conqueror because the enemy looks at you and thinks, "Can't beat him, can't beat that girl, so let's just fight the battles that we can win. We can't win this one." He is going to cut his losses.  
	Warriors take cities and take nations because warriors make it difficult for the enemy. Warriors are more than conquerors. The enemy would love you to stay a foot soldier. He would hate it for you to become a warrior.  
	Let's pray.

	Father, I thank You we are all living in a place of habitation with You. We are all living from that place of Christ within the expectation of glory. We are a habitation of God in the Spirit, and the law of life in Christ Jesus applies to us always. It is the law of life in Christ Jesus that we should pray and get our prayers answered, that we should rise above our circumstance and occupy a revelation and a position that Heaven is affording us. It is the law of life in Christ Jesus that we will overflow and overcome.   
	So, Father, I ask In Jesus' name, that You would begin to immerse each one of us in all the possibilities of overcoming and overflowing. Change our hearts, change our minds, renew our thinking so that we realize the heritage that we have in the Lord Jesus Christ, that You would make each one of us invincible, that You would take each one of us and teach us and train us how to live above our circumstances so that we are only ever challenged by the brilliance of the Father, that we would only be under challenge from You, and that every situation, therefore, will be a challenge for us to receive all that You have for us and assigned to us in those circumstances.  
	Father, I thank You that right now You are messing with our head, and You are causing us to see what an amazing life is possible, and You are causing us to see the reality of being Christ-minded. To think like He thinks, that would be our greatest pleasure, our biggest joy, our greatest treasure. "I see it\! I see it the way You see it\! I get it\! I understand it, and now I want to become it."  
	Holy Spirit, thank You for being with us, and I ask that You would continue to touch us, that we understand our heritage, and we understand our inheritance in the Lord Jesus Christ.   
	There is not an ordinary person in this room. There is no mediocrity on view in this room. There is fullness on offer, and nobody in this room has baggage. We just have luggage that we haven't unpacked yet. We are not present-past, we are present-future. We have a hope, and every one of us listening has the potential to be just as brilliant as Jesus because we live in an habitation with Him. We abide in His favor, in His generosity, in His power, in His wisdom, and nothing will be impossible for us because all things are possible with God.  
	So In Jesus' name, Father, we just bless You for Your provision, for Your foresight, for You intentionality, for Your promises, for the joy that You have of causing each one of us to step up into a whole new place of being. And I pray that we will do it, Father, with absolute excellence. And I ask, too, that we will leave here this weekend planning to get revenge on the enemy by enjoying all that You are and all that You bring to each one of us.   
	For Jesus's sake, amen.

	Thank you for listening. I really appreciate it\!

Disc 4

	Holy Spirit, please try and turn this meeting around. Okay, so I am talking on a subject dear to Your heart now, and I really need Your help. Thank You.  
	I just want to say again how much I love You, how important You are in my life. Thank You for all that You have just declared about the Lord Jesus. I am so struck by how You adore Him, how You are so committed to making Him known. You amaze me\! Your generosity amazes me. You are the most exciting person I know. You are the most excitable person I know. You are the most enthusiastic person I have ever met in my entire life. You are a sign and a wonder all by Yourself\!  
	So, please, here we are. We love you. We want to connect with You more and more. So come and do what You are astonishingly brilliant at. Touch us, inspire us, stimulate us, move on our hearts, cause us to hunger and thirst for the things of Jesus. For His sake, amen.

	I want to talk to you this afternoon about the goodness of God. It was the relationship between God and Moses that first gave us the revelation that glory and goodness were bound together in the heart of God. In Exodus 33, get ready, I am opening the Bible.   
	Do you ever have those situations where you know that God is maneuvering you into a place where you can ask Him for the thing He most wants to give you? Have you ever had that encounter, that experience with God? And You know that He is just dancing you all over the room just to get you into that corner where you just suddenly squeak out (in a high-pitched voice), "Show me your glory\!" It doesn't matter to Him how you say it as long as you say it. It doesn't matter if you sound like Peewee Herman on steroids. It doesn't matter at all.  
	So He gets Moses to the place where he says this, Exodus 33:18, *Moses said, "I pray You, show me Your glory." And God said to him, "I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you."* That would be a lot of goodness. I imagine he was up there for quite a while. *And I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion." But the Lord said, "You can't see my face for no man can see me and live."* It's not because there is any kind of threat attached to it, it's just that the face of God, the Presence of God is so blindingly brilliant it would incinerate anybody if they got in front of God in their natural state.   
	You know, when Jesus comes back, those who go up in the air to meet Him are going to be changed otherwise they would arrive in heaven like a burnt crisp. You'd be a real burnt offering right there\!  
	*No man can see My face and live. And the Lord said, "Behold there is a place with Me and you shall stand there in the rock, and it will come about while my glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I pass by.* Why is that necessary? Because the goodness of God is so blindingly astonishing, Moses would literally go up in a puff of smoke. He would be incinerated.   
	I find it fascinating in that God is saying, "My goodness is so powerful, I am going to have to protect you from it while you are in that state." I thought that was good anyway. "Then I will take My hand away and you can see My back, but My face shall not be seen." So Moses has an encounter with goodness that was so powerful, it made his face shine with such a radiance that in public he had to live with a veil over his face.   
	This is the Old Testament. This was in a visitational culture. Encounters like that so incredible they border on fantasy almost. That's the thing for me about the Gospel. It is such astonishing good news, so astounding, so amazing, so incredible it borders on fantasy. You know we have a pessimistic saying in the world that if something is too good to be true, someone is being conned. But in the Kingdom, if it is not too good to be true, it's not God. The Gospel is so bright, so shining, so astonishing, so incredible, so amazing when you connect with it, it can take you to places in the realm of God that you are going to need an imagination to access just to even think about it\! You can't think about those things logically. There is a point where your spirituality has to go way beyond your intellect, and you can only access that way of thinking through wisdom, through revelation, through encounter, through imagination with God. The reason God gave you an imagination and the reason that He speaks to people in dreams and visions is because those things are not based in any kind of logic or rationale, but they open you up to a realm of thinking that logic is incapable of getting to.  
	Let me read you Exodus 34:29, *When Moses was coming down from Mt. Sinai and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him. So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come near him. And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. Afterwards all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them to do everything that the Lord had spoken to him on Mt. Sinai. When Moses finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face, but whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out, and whenever he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he had been commanded, the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone, so Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him.*  
	It is interesting that whole juxtaposition, how that whole thing gets turned around. We go into places of hiddeness with God because God works by hiddeness and manifestation. In manifestation God invades your world and shows up big time and you are changed, but in hiddeness, He pulls you into His world. It is fascinating to me that Moses had to hide his face in public, but he could have an open face with God in private. It is like a complete switcheroo right there.   
	The glory and the goodness of God were so strong that Moses needed to be protected in his earthly state from the power of it by the hand of God. Just that thought alone resonates so deeply in my spirit that, guys, we have got a really good ways to go. But it is a good way to go\! I mean, if you are going to die, get incinerated by goodness\!  
	The glory of God is in His unending goodness. His goodness and His glory must fill the earth even as it fills heaven. We are looking in these days, our whole reason for being in the Kingdom is to have a lifestyle that says, "On earth as it is in heaven." We want the same reality on earth that Heaven is enjoying because that is what Jesus came to give us. He came to give us a glimpse of what the Kingdom really is like. He came to give us a taster, and then He said, *Greater things than these will you do.*   
	God's passion for goodness is so strong, it changes whoever comes into contact with it. David knew from his encounters with God that goodness was following him all the days of his life, and he wrote about it in his journal, in Psalm 23:6. He knew that goodness was the antidote to despair. Psalm 27:13, *I would have despaired unless I have believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.*  
	What if all your emotions, therefore, actually arise out of goodness so that we are not actually vulnerable to things going on in the world that can affect us adversely, but we are taking our cue from one place and one place only? All my emotions can rise up out of the place of goodness because the goodness of God overcomes everything that is negative and would cause me to despair personally.  
	Romans 2:4 says *the goodness of God is what leads people to repentance.* Goodness enables every one of us to change our thinking, to think differently, to live a different way, to pursue a different way, to explore a different dimension of spirituality. Goodness empowers us.  
	All people that are touched by God's goodness come into a deeper place of encounter with Him. What would it look like for you to encounter this incomparable goodness of God to such a degree it totally changed your personality, your whole identity was adjusted, your whole identity was free to go to the level of God's permission because in your life you had come to a place where you were being ruled by one thing, by the goodness of God? Psalm 31:19 says that God has stored up goodness for each of His beloved children who revere Him. So I guess you have got some upgrades coming. There is a storehouse in heaven that has your name on it, and it is full of goodness.   
	If you are going to believe something about God, believe something outrageous. Believe something out of the ordinary. Don't believe for the ordinary stuff, believe for something lavish, something generous, something huge.  
	It is important for you as an individual and for your family, and for your family line, that you understand there is a huge deposit of goodness that has your name on it. It is important that we don't just see goodness contained in isolated acts of benevolence in Jesus, but we see it as a lifestyle expectation, as part of our relational experience that you are never more than a finger-touch from the goodness of God, that you have an expectation all around you, no matter who you come into contact with, goodness is following you. Goodness and mercy are following you, and they are good\! You can't shake these dudes off. They are trackers. They are tracking you down. God is hunting you down even as I speak. He is closing off all your avenues of escape. He is hunting you down for the express purpose of making you aware that you can have encounters and experiences with His goodness, which are utterly compelling and life-changing. Not only that, anyone you connect with is going to get ruined by the goodness of God in you.   
	Goodness is both a breakthrough encounter and an ongoing lifestyle in experience. Acts 10:38 says that *Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.* The power of God's goodness was so legendary towards His people that all of the nations round and about Israel would revere it and worship Him, and the enemy would tremble because of it because they knew they could not overcome the goodness of God to Israel. They knew that Israel was highly favored, and they knew flat out they couldn't beat them in a fight because the goodness of God on their side was so powerful it made them unbeatable, and nations trembled. In the book of Acts it was said that *the people who have turned the world upside down,* the goodness of God, "Oh my gosh\! They have come here, too\!" Nobody was neutral about the early disciples in the church. No one was neutral about them. It's like, "Ach, well, you know, just a bunch of Christians..." No, these guys were rocking their neighborhoods with the goodness of God. No one was safe\!  
	Goodness has always been ever present in all that God is and does. It is one of the fruits of the Spirit, and it is also the fruit of light in our lives, Eph. 5:29. Goodness is the fruit of light. God wants you living in such incomparable goodness it changes everyone that you come into connection with. Goodness creates a radiance of Christ that affects people. Goodness, therefore, is the true hallmark of every disciple. What you do in the goodness of God is incredible. No one is safe, not even your enemies. The Bible says that a good man reveals the treasures of his goodness to the world, Matt. 12:35, and he walks in a manner worthy of God's nature because goodness pleases the Lord, Col. 1:10. It is only when we commit ourselves to goodness that we truly come under an increase of knowledge, and an upgrade of our experience of God Himself.   
	The purpose of the Holy Spirit is to get you to commit to goodness, not as an idea, not as a concept, but as a lifestyle, that everything about you is governed by the goodness of God. Scratch you, and goodness is going to come out. Nothing works against you because goodness is going to pour out of you. It is going to come out of the pores of your skin. Not even your enemies, especially your enemies are not safe. No one is safe. In fact, when you are traveling in the goodness of God, you don't recognize enemies.  
	I had a guy come up to me in Kansas City and he said, "I want you to know I hate everything you stand for." He said, "You are a heretic. You are apostate. You are a false teacher. I hate everything you stand for, and I am against you. I am your enemy."  
	I said, "Dude, you're not. Trust me on that one. You're not."  
	He said, "No, I am being serious here. I hate everything you stand for. I am your enemy."  
	I said, "No, you're not."  
	He said, "I am\!"  
	I said, "Dude, you're not."  
	He was getting really annoyed. He stamped his foot and he said, "I am\!"  
	I said, "Dude, you can't be\!"  
	He said, "Why?"  
	I said, "It's Tuesday\! I don't take enemies on Tuesday\!" It's like, "What kind of pelican are you? You didn't know that?"  
	And he looks at me, and he went bright red, and he went, "I'll come back tomorrow\!"  
	I said, "Oh, that's good because that is Wednesday. I have a special on Wednesday for people who want to be my enemy. I have a special. Yeah, come back tomorrow. I will pray for you."  
	"You're not laying hands on me\!"  
	I said, "I don't have to. Dude, you can't stop me praying. I will go back to my hotel room and pray. It will be the same result as if you were stood in front of me. But here's the thing, son: I am not in the market for enemies. But thanks anyway, I appreciate the offer. But you can't be my enemy unless I receive you as one, and I'm just not in the mood, haven't got the time. Rather have a cup of coffee with you. I am definitely not taking you as an enemy. But I will pray for you for the goodness of God."  
	So he just looked at me, shook his head, and walked away.  
	But I have a feeling I will be seeing him.  
	You can't ever separate goodness from glory.  
	The Bible says that all men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. I wonder if he is talking about, "Well, somewhere along the line you stopped being good. You stopped being amazingly good. You stopped thinking about goodness as a way of life. Somewhere along the way you let go of something beautiful. You let go of goodness." I think we fall short of glory when we fail to practice goodness.  
	Goodness is critical in times of opposition and warfare. We are to love our enemies and do good to them. Let me read you something else in the Bible. Luke 6:27, *But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other one also. Whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him, either. Give to everyone who asks of you, and*   
*whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back. Treat others the same way you want them to treat you. If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you, for even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount. But love your enemies and do go and lend expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.*   
	He is talking about a level of goodness here that transcends everything, a level of goodness so profound, it literally doesn't matter what people are doing. Goodness is a way of life, to live in a place of such incomparable goodness that you are not scared about being taken for granted, you are not worried about being abused or your resources being abused. None of those things concern you. You are not concerned remotely about what other people do with the goodness that you put out. All you are concerned about is, "I want to do good. I don't want to have favorites. I don't want to say, 'Well, I'm not doing it for him, and I'm not doing it for them, and they'd only waste it, they'll only abuse it.'" It doesn't matter.  
	Here's the thing about goodness: You can't be in charge of it. You don't get to say who you give goodness to. You don't get to play favorites. You don't get to give goodness as a reward. You get to give it because that is the nature of God. And you don't get to give it with any conditions. "Well, I'll do this if you do that. Alright, I mean, you wasted the last lot so no more for you." You don't get to employ conditions. You don't get to play favorites. You get just to be good.   
	We never suspend the power to do good in any circumstances of life. Goodness has an extraordinary power for the giver as well as the recipient.   
	Years ago in my home town in South Hampton there was a church leader and preacher who was speaking against the prophetic in the city and me in particular. So I think over the course of a year he preached more about me than he did about Jesus, and everything was, "Don't go near him. If you see him walking down the street, cross over the road. Don't look into his eyes. Don't talk to him." Apparently I was the second cousin three times removed to the devil himself. So everything was against me. I was doing schools of prophecy and that made me an outlaw in some sections so that was fascinating.   
	What began to happen over time was that the numbers in his congregation (it was an independent church) began to dwindle. I remember some of my friends at the time came and said, "His numbers are falling so the income for the church is dropping, you know, God is judging him," and they were, like, really glad about it. 	And I said, "Guys, that's not right. We can't think that way. We want this guy to succeed. He is a brother. If he is not behaving like one, that's got nothing to do with us. His own behavior is between him and the Lord. I am not going to judge who he is, and I certainly don't want you being glad that he is failing." So we had some interesting conversations about that, and then a few months later his numbers were so low his income was being affected.   
	I remember the Lord waking me up at 2:00 in the morning and saying, "I want you to go to the ATM."  
	I said, "Why? Are you short of cash?"  
	And He said, "No, (and He showed me this guy) but he is."  
	So I get up at like 2:30 in the morning, go to the ATM, draw out a couple of thousand pounds, and then I have to drive around to his house with an envelope. In England we have the letter box set in the front door, so you can put the thing right into the house. So I'm tiptoeing down his garden path at like 3:00 in the morning, kneeling down, I'm thinking, "Dear Lord, don't let any policeman come by right now because they'll never believe me\!" And I put this thing, and the Lord said, "Put the money in," and I couldn't put my name on it or anything but "Bless his house." So I am speaking blessings through the letter box into his house, and then flicking the money in. And so two or three times a month the Lord would show me an amount, and I would draw it out, and I would be giving this guy money.  
	And he begins waving bank notes in the air. "See, the Lord is blessing my ministry. I am right\!" Which was just flat out funny\! I laughed\! That was so funny.  
He was holding up the provision as a sign of God's vindication. That's just silly. 	But it didn't matter to me that he got it wrong because eventually I knew he would get it right because of God's goodness. The fascinating thing for me was that whole act of goodness saved me from an awful lot of anger and hassle and recrimination and all the stuff you really don't want to get involved in, you know, because sometimes it is our response to things like that that really wears us out. If you engage negativity with negativity, you are not doing yourself any favors, really.   
	Then I got a great opportunity with him. His daughter was in a car accident. The thing is he'd gotten such a poor reputation in the city that people were saying that his daughter's accident was a judgment from God. It's just bizarre how people think, that God would actually lower Himself, you know, you're talking a fourteen year old girl, that God would lower Himself to injuring a fourteen year old girl for the sake of teaching her stupid dad a lesson? You really think God is like that? You need your bumps read\!  
	So people were saying, though, that's a sign from God. And so I found out which hospital she was in, and I went down. I walked into the room, and he is sat by her bed. He looks at me, and he says, "What are you doing here?"  
	I said, "I'm here to pray for your daughter, man."  
	"I don't want someone like you praying for my daughter\!"  
	I said, "Well, you know what, looking around I don't see too many volunteers. But you and I, you know, in Jesus, where two or three are gathered..."  
	He said, "I don't trust you."  
	I said, "Well, I trust you, and one of the things I'm trusting is that you really are not that dumb that you wouldn't put your daughter's health at risk because of your supposed enmity with me."  
	He said, "There is nothing supposed about it\!"  
	I said, "Dude, we are going to be praying in a few minutes. Lighten up\!"  
	He said, "I don't want to pray with you."  
	I said, "Okay, I'll pray outside. But this is what I'm going to pray if you're interested."  
	And so I went outside and just stood there in the corridor, and I'm praying.   
	The door opened and he came out and he looked at me and he said, "I don't know how to pray for her."  
	I said, "I know. Well, let's just do it together, man." So we prayed, and she was, you know, in a coma. Hey, but God is good\! So pretty soon she wasn't.   
	But here's the thing: Those are the moments in goodness that make everything worthwhile. Prayed for a girl who was in distress, and God heard our cry and released her, and I turned an enemy into a friend. Not a great friend, but a friend. You know, this is not Hollywood. We didn't become best buddies, but we could talk to each other. I could phone him up and say, "How's it going?" I actually said to him one day, "So tell me something, what are you using for sermons now you can't hate me anymore?"  
	And he laughed and he said, "Oh, I'm just talking about Jesus these days\!"  
	You get moments with people, and you only need a moment. You only need one moment with people. And really, I think, maturity in the Spirit is waiting for that moment and choosing it.  
	But here's the thing: You are not defined by what other people do to you. You can only be defined by who God is for you. No one can make you angry. You can't say, "Well, he did this and he made me really angry\!" Come on\! Nobody makes you angry. You chose to be angry. You chose it, no one made you do that. You could have chosen grace and mercy and kindness. Ach, no, but you had to choose anger. What's that about? They didn't make you angry. Maybe they did something that caused the anger in you to rise. They didn't put anger in you; maybe it was already there. Sometimes people only reveal to us the things we already have present. You know those people who get right up your nose? They get on your last nerve? "That guy just really makes me grind my teeth\!" Well, stop it, because dentist's cost a lot of money\!  
	"He makes me this..." No, he doesn't. That stuff is already in you, man. You are choosing it. Stop choosing it and it will leave. It will go find some other idiot who will pick it up and use it. But you need to stop being the idiot. (I'm talking to myself now. I hope you realize that.)  
	True disciples have a passion to prove what is good. They cleave, they cling to what is good. They are devoted to goodness because they see it as the only lifestyle that can truly represent the nature of God. For Christ's sake, we must abound in goodness and be filled up with it, be giving it away every opportunity. If you give goodness away it will protect you in the giving, and you won't have to take on board all that negative stuff that other people's actions are pushing your way. You can repel that with goodness. You can learn to express His passion for generosity, to be lavish, to be profuse, to be extravagant in His loving kindness. It's a great thing, it's such a privilege to put things into the hand of God, to put resources, to put gifts into the hands of God.  
	I love giving financially. I love putting money into the hands of God. I like giving. I like the nature of God. I like the generosity of God. I love the way that He thinks about us. You know, like anybody else in this room, I am learning to be Christ-like in some of those things. All God's attributes of love, gentleness, grace, mercy, patience, and kindness are all acts that are rooted in His goodness toward us.   
	To walk in the Spirit is to be careful to maintain acts of goodness in our own lifestyle. It is not an option. It is the only viable expression of the Kingdom. Every situation, every circumstance that we encounter is to be used to express the goodness of God. Everything that happens to us is a challenge to the Father's goodness in us and through us.   
	So here is the point I want to make: What if we cannot be challenged by life, by oppositional people, or by the enemy. What if we can only ever be challenged by the goodness of God? What if everything in your life is just a challenge to God's goodness?   
	If you accept it as a challenge from the enemy, then you have to do warfare. The enemy loves to draw you into warfare that is never going to go anywhere, that is just designed to weary you. You never fight the enemy on his terms. Just because he shows up rattling his sword against his shield doesn't mean you have to fight him. You fight him when God tells you to fight him. Sometimes the enemy shows up and he just wants to wear you out. But what he is really trying to do is distract you. Sometimes the enemy wants to distract you into warfare so that you miss the whole point of what's going on. He doesn't want you opposing him in the fruit of the Spirit. He wants you using your own energy to take authority over him so he can wear you out. He distracts you into a fight.   
	Your role is to stay and abide in Jesus, and you only fight when Jesus tells you to fight. You have to have an order from the Commander to fight. Just because the enemy shows up doesn't mean you should go charging across a field and engage him. You engage him when God tells you to engage him. The rest of the time you ignore him and you focus on Jesus.   
	The enemy is such a megalomaniac he loves all the attention. He would love you to focus on him.	  
	I remember years ago when I was pastoring a church and God helped me, actually God helped them, and I remember I was in my office and I'm trying to write my talk for the next Sunday, and all I can hear from next door is, "What's your name? Come out in the name of Jesus\!" And it's going on for like an hour and a half. So eventually I get up and go out in the corridor and I knock on the door. Guy opens it. He's got his shirt undone, he's got his tie all loosened, his sleeves are rolled up, and he is all sweaty and red-faced.  
	I said, "Dude, what are you doing?"  
	He said, "We're casting out some devils."  
	I said, "Well, I lost count at around 73."  
	And he went, "Yeah, it's pretty heavy stuff."  
	I said, "Man, word of advice. It's a lying spirit."  
	He went, "Gotcha, boss\!" Slams the door in my face, I go back into my office, and I hear him say, "Come out, you lying spirit\!" Ahhhhhhhhhhhh\!   
	Peace\!  
	"What's your name? What's your name?" Flipping thing was lying to him for an hour and a half\! All of your best moves are on DVD in heaven. You might be in the comedy section next to Mr. Bean. That would be you\!  
	What if we can only ever be challenged by the goodness of God? Please don't get distracted into warfare. You only do what the Father is doing. If He is not going up against the enemy...in the Old Testament they would say, "Shall I go up against the enemy?" It's a viable question for the New Testament. "Shall I go up against the enemy? Will you deliver him into my hand?" God chose the moments of conflict. We don't choose them. Don't get distracted into warfare. Fight when God tells you to fight.   
	The fruit of the Spirit is a more potent weapon against the enemy than the gifts. Patience is a brilliant weapon. One of my practices is I am learning how to stay fresher for longer, to start every day fresh, so I don't want to carry anything negative from yesterday into today. I want to end my day in celebration. Then I want to start fresh in the morning. I am not letting the enemy accumulate stuff in my life.   
	Talked to a guy the other week. He said, "Oh, you know, this has been going on for a month. It's wearing me out."  
	I said, "Dude, you do realize you can be fresh every day. You need to submit to a refreshing. Right now you are submitting to a good kicking, and you're getting one\! You should submit to a refreshing. New every morning is the goodness of God, the kindness of God, the compassion and the mercies of God. Start every day fresh. End every day with celebration so you can start every day fresh. That's going to wear the enemy out because he is hoping that, you know, it's back to that whole budget thing. The enemy likes you to accumulate weariness and tiredness because then you will start saying things like, "I'll be glad when this is over\!" which basically means you are not going to be glad now. You are postponing gladdness. "I'll be glad when it's over." What if it's not going to be over for three more weeks? You are going to be miserable for three weeks? What are you thinking? You are postponing something. You are delaying your blessing. You are pushing your upgrade further away. Staying fresher longer is viable spirituality, but it's rooted in the goodness of God, that you know that God is good.   
	The enemy wants you to use your circumstances to challenge God's goodness, and God is saying, "No, you take My goodness and you challenge your circumstances. You are being challenged to see My goodness." Again, it doesn't matter whether your situation is good, bad, or ugly. It can't stop, it can't separate you from the goodness of God. You are only being challenged by goodness.  
	What does that look like for you? We are being challenged to live, think, speak, and act for the good in every circumstance. It absolutely doesn't matter what anybody else is doing. It only matters what you are doing. It doesn't matter what their identity is, what is showing up. It matters what your identity is. It doesn't matter what they believe about you, it's about what you believe about God.   
	It's a fun thing to write to some of my detractors. I just say, "Hey, man\! I was thinking about you the other day and I felt the Lord just give me this word for you. I hope it blesses you." So far no one has written back. But you know, that is not the reward I am looking for. The reward I am looking for is the fact that I did it. I was Jesus in that situation, and I saved myself an awful lot of hassle. It means I don't have to deal with their stuff. You never have to deal with their stuff, you just have to deal with your own.  
	Don't let the enemy fool you into dealing with somebody else's stuff. You just deal with your own. You live the way that you want to live. You are defined by who you want to be in Jesus, and by who He is for you. That is a good place to live from. Romans 8:28 says that *God makes all things work together for good to those who love God and to those who are called according to His purpose.*   
	That means you love God in the situation you are in because remember we said every issue up front is never the issue. Everything is about relationship so every single issue is about your relationship with God. It is about you knowing that you are the Beloved, and that you choose to love God as a priority in that situation. Then when you have really settled, you have immersed your heart in love, then you come into alignment with the purpose of God in the situation itself because we all know that we have all faced situations that have not worked together for good. Right? Because we didn't fulfill the conditions, *to those who love God and to those who are called according to His purpose* in the situation that you face.   
	The first requirement in any set of circumstances is that you get into the face of God for the sake of love because He is pursuing you for the sake of love. So love is always on the agenda of God, that you are the Beloved and you act like it. You get into His face, you receive love from God, and that gives you an anointing to see this situation differently and to become in alignment with His purpose in that particular instance.   
	It is goodness that makes us radiant. It is your role in the earth to have a radiant idea of God, and a radiant idea of the Kingdom, and a radiant idea of who you are in the affections of Jesus, and a radiant idea of the church, and anybody who touches you gets touched by that brilliance. They get moved by you. Goodness makes us radiant.  
	In goodness we are always prepared. We are equipped. We are ready for God to do His best in every situation. So here's a question: Who around your life needs an encounter with goodness? In your family, in your friends, in your place of work, in your neighborhood, who needs an encounter with goodness?   
	Next question: Who is the most difficult person around your life? You may be married to him\! I think my wife is\! Who is the most difficult person around your life? Practice. What do you think they are there for? They are your shortcut into something brilliant. You are around them a lot. They are your shortcut. They are your blessing. That could be your giant that opens up some new territory for you. Hey, better the devil you know than the one you have yet to meet\! If you refuse this one, the next one could be a heck of a lot worse\! Take what you can get. Practice on the dude you have got in front of you. Don't be trying to change him out for something else; you might get something worse. There is a reason why you are working in that company with that obnoxious boss. It is your shortcut into becoming Christ-like. Practice some goodness.   
	What difficulties around your life need to be immersed in the goodness of God? In every situation there is only one challenge facing you. It is the challenge of God's goodness to overcome everything in you and around you. You are only being challenged by the goodness of God. No matter how difficult, how hard, you are being challenged by goodness. Don't put the blame on somebody else. You are being challenged by the goodness of God. He is saying to you, "The way into that person's life is My goodness. The way to overcome here is My goodness. The way to maintain who you are in the Spirit is through goodness." You are only being challenged by the goodness of God.  
	But here's the thing: When you meet a difficult person, God is challenging you to bring a higher measure of good into their life than the difficulty they are bringing into yours. He is saying, "See that person? Their difficulty level rating is seven out of ten in your life. I want your goodness rating to be eight out of ten at least. I want you to submerge their difficulty in My goodness. I want you to be at least as good for them as they are bad for you."   
	But that's just a tie. That's no good\! We want to win the championship. You don't win the championship through tying every game. You want all the points. Yeah? You are in a fight\! You should be in it to win it.  
	So who are the difficult people around you? You understand that they are there to upgrade you in goodness? They perhaps don't quite see it that way, but that's the purpose of God. That is why He has sent them. That is why He allowed them. They are there to bring you into an upgrade of goodness. They are not there so that you can practice being an idiot. They are there for you to practice being Christ-like. They are there for you to practice the goodness of God in their life.  
	"Yeah, but he's obnoxious\!"   
	Uh-huh. Jesus passing through a village, everyone wants Him to stay. He looks up in a tree, and He sees this little guy called Zacchaeus. Jesus knows exactly what is going on, that Zacchaeus is an obnoxious little rat who has defrauded that whole community, and He singles out the one person in that whole community for a blessing. He chooses to demonstrate His goodness to Zacchaeus, the one who was least deserving got the goodness.   
	So Jesus looked up and said, "Zacchaeus, come down for I must eat with you this evening." Everyone wanted Him to stay overnight and eat at their house, and He chooses Zacchaeus, an incredible honor. And Zacchaeus is overwhelmed by the goodness. And so Jesus moves on, and by the time Zacchaeus gets down out of that tree...he is not up a tree because he is small in stature and he can't see above the crowd. He is up a tree because he is a little rat, everyone hates him, and if he stands still for more than five seconds in a crowd, someone is going to stick a knife between his third and fourth rib\! He is up a tree for protection.   
	By the time he gets out of the tree and scuttles up to Jesus' side, something has happened on the inside of him, and the first thing he says is, "I want to give half my goods to the poor, and if (and the tense is if-and-I-have) defrauded anybody, I will pay them back four times as much."   
	Jesus never said anything. He just demonstrated goodness.  
	Can you imagine what happened the next day? The elders get a phone call in the morning, "Can I meet you in the gate of the city?" and they're all going, "No." They are all texting each other, "The Rat just called me\! He wants to have a meeting." So all the elders are gathered, "What's going on?" "I don't know\!" But they couldn't afford to ignore him because he was a powerful man. So they are all sat there thinking this is going to be a great day. A brilliant day yesterday with Jesus, and now today we have got the Rat.  
	So they see him with his entourage coming down, and two guys carrying this chest, and they are standing there, and they are normally used to Zacchaeus being arrogant and forceful and belligerent. And he just comes up and they look at him and there is something different about his face.   
	And he just says, "Um, I know I haven't been the kind of person that I should have been. But I really want to change. Anyway, um, there is no reason why you should believe me, but I just, um...this is half of everything that I own. I want you guys just to take it and share it around the community with any poor person. Anyway, I, um, I am just going to leave it with you." And he walks away. 	And they are, like, going, "What, is it going to be full of cockroaches or something?" So they open it up. It is full of money. And you can imagine them sitting down thinking, "What the heck just happened? I wonder what Jesus said to him? He didn't look frightened, though. He looked peaceful. Huh\!"  
	And all through that community, all through the day, people are getting a knock on their door. Imagine it is lunchtime, and you are just putting the stuff in the dishwasher, and you open the door, and there is the person you hate the most who has stripped you of any dignity and kept you poor, robbed you, and he is standing there, and you want to give him some five-fold ministry. But you look at his face, and there is something you haven't seen on his face before.  
	And he looks at you, and he just says, "Look, um, I did a great wickedness in your life, and I just want you to know I am sorry, man. And I, you know, I want to be different, you know, and I know your history with me is not great. I don't expect you to believe me. But anyway, I want you to have this." And he hands you a bag and turns and walks away. You are standing there and you know it's money; you can hear the clink. And you shut the door, and your wife comes in from the kitchen, you know, drying her hands on a towel.  
	"Who was that?"  
	"Zacchaeus."  
	"What did that little rat want?"  
	"Well, he just apologized to me."  
	"He did what?"  
	"He apologized for defrauding us, and he gave me this." And you pour the money out on the table. When you count it out, it is four times the amount that he took from you. And you are standing there with your arms around each other, and you can't even hardly believe what just happened. And you say, "What did just happen?"  
	Well, the Kingdom happened. The King walked through your community and spread His goodness. And He chose the one man to give His goodness to, and then that man gave it away to everybody else in the community. And the worst person in your community is used to bring the whole level economically of that region up several levels. It's like the whole community won the lottery. What's that? That's goodness. That is goodness at work.   
	It's not your job to judge who can receive goodness or to think, "Well, if I give him goodness, then this could happen..." You just do what the Lord is telling you to do. But you understand that from now on your life is being challenged by one thing only: The goodness of God.   
	Be the first to move in goodness, and maintain the lifestyle.  
	We are not worldly people. We're not. We are Kingdom people. We don't repay evil with evil. We seek after what is good for one another and for all people. 1 Thess. 5:15. Seeking after everyone's good is the real challenge of our spirituality.   
	It is goodness that puts our lives into alignment. We come into alignment with Heaven and we release its resources. When we have a reputation for doing good, 1 Tim. 5:10, we become rich in goodness and God receives amazing glory. Our testimony of God's goodness creates a power and an authority to overturn all degredations of the enemy in the lives of people around us. We are only ever being challenged by goodness. No one is safe from the power of goodness. People will repent when they taste it. Not just random acts of kindness, but a lifestyle of bringing intentional goodness into the lives of people. Not doing a goodness hit, you know, not a drive-by blessing.   
	Will we be taken for granted? Certainly. Will our goodness be abused? Count on it. Will people think we are foolish? Definitely\!   
	Here is the real truth behind all those impositions: Peter said in 1 Peter 3:13, *Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?* In goodness you cannot be robbed. You cannot be harmed. You cannot be defrauded because God is the one that resources your goodness. It is His money, it's not yours so don't take it personally. Truth is, it doesn't matter if you are maligned. We are not doing it for results. We are not doing it for man's approval. We are doing it for the glory of God. We are being challenged by Heaven to look at life through the lens of God's goodness, to see everyone and everything in the light of His goodness and mercy. We are a visual aid to the whole earth. They don't read their Bible, but they do read their Christians. We are a visual aid to the world so that they can touch Heaven. We are the physical, tangible evidence that God is brilliantly, incredibly, astonishingly full of goodness.  
	God is good. There is no higher truth and no better way to represent His glory than through goodness. 

	Let's pray.  
	  
	Father, I pray for a fresh revelation of your nature in goodness. I ask that You would overtake our hearts with the goodness of God, that You would fill us with an overwhelming desire to walk in the goodness of God, to prove the goodness of God, that we would ourselves have continuous encounters with Your goodness, that we would be fully persuaded about the power of Your goodness in the earth, that You would change our lifestyle so that we have an ongoing experience of Your goodness, that You would get a hold of us in such a powerful way that our maturity will be defined by the goodness that we express.  
	I ask, Lord, in this place for a radiant expression of the goodness and the glory of God to combine in our hearts so that our faces will shine, and our lives will be brilliant, and people will see the brilliance, the glory of the light of Your goodness, and that the fruit of the light of goodness in our life would be like a beacon in the darkness cutting its way through to finding that person who is absolutely most in need of a transformation, that we would transform whole communities through being good just for the sake of it, just for the joy of it, just for the splendor of it.   
	But I ask especially, Lord God, that we would leave this place knowing this truth. We can't be challenged by the enemy. We can't be challenged by circumstances. And we are not being challenged by oppositional people. We are being challenged by the goodness of God, to see that goodness, and to release it for the greater glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
	Lord, may that revelation take hold of us in such a powerful way that we will be transformed in His image. Amen.

	Thank you so much for listening. I appreciate it.

DISC 5

	Holy Spirit, what a genius you are\! Thank You so much, we have had such a great time with You. Thank You. Thank You for being with us. Thank You for all that You do. Thank You for being Lord in the church. We know that Jesus is Lord over the church, but You are Lord in the church, and You take every aspect of His lordship and you disclose it to us. You are the one that opens doors and windows in heaven. You are the one that walks amongst us encouraging, comforting, teaching, exhorting, training, equipping, releasing, empowering. You are astonishing. I know You know that, but I just like saying it. And I love Your gentle humor, and that really weird comedy thing You have going. I like that\! I love the way that You love us, the way that You love to be involved in our lives. You like us to involve you, but you also love to invade. You are a space invader\! The best kind\! And I love the fact, too, that if we resist the dove, You turn yourself into water and nobody can stop water. It seeps into every crack. It goes around things. It goes over things. It goes under things. It can't be stopped. But if it could be stopped, You would just turn yourself into wind, and nothing can stop the wind. So you have this ability, you won't be refused. You just keep coming back in all Your forms. My special preference is when You turn yourself into wine because wine makes the heart glad.  
	But You are so welcome here. Thank You for your strength, Your power, but also for Your gentleness and Your faithfulness. Thank You for Your commitment to us, unceasing, unrelenting, unchanging.   
	So come and do what You do best, inspire us, stimulate us, breathe upon us, cause us to know how important we are in the Kingdom and how much we are loved and valued by Heaven. For Jesus' sake, because I know that You love to represent who He is. So for His sake, because He is worth everything. Amen.

	The existence of a negative always proves the positive. You cannot have a negative without a positive being present. You can't have a curse without a blessing being somewhere on the horizon. Every problem has a provision. Every anxiety has a promise. All our identity is wrapped up in prophecy, and even despair can be turned into goodness. Every negative must always be accompanied by a positive.   
	Jesus took the curse away from us, and so He has released us into fullness of blessing. And that's a wonderful thing for us because the curse involves fear, anxiety, depression, desperation, all those things are involved because they are all the effects of curse. He has not just taken the curse, He has taken all the effects so now being anxious and fearful is illegal behavior because now we have peace, and we have joy, and we have love, and we have rest. And that's our true nature, is to be at peace. Our true nature is to be joyful, is to be happy, is to be cheerful. We are the most cheerful people on the face of the earth because we are happy in the strength of God's affection for us. So Jesus took the curse and He releases a blessing on us instead. That's why on the Sermon on the Mount He said, "Blessed are you...blessed is the man..." and He began to pour out all the blessings that are available from Heaven "for all those who will follow Me, all those who are in Me, and all who I am in."  
	He is in you, so all of Heaven is attracted to you because of Jesus in you. Heaven is attracted to Jesus, so it is dead easy to get blessed in the Kingdom because Jesus is a magnet. He is a magnet for blessing. He is a magnet for increase. He is a magnet for upgrade. Everything good comes out of Heaven, comes straight into your spirit because that is where Jesus is. So He attracts the blessing and the favor of Heaven.  
	The existence of a negative, therefore, proves that a positive is also available. Jesus said in Mark 9:23, *All things are possible, only believe.* The way in which He meant it was absolutely everything in life is a possibility, and all you have to do is just believe. He took everything and reduced it to a ridiculous simplicity. "Everything is possible, and I am going to teach you to live in the land where everything, every single thing, is a possibility from Heaven, and all I am requiring you to do is just believe."  
	The origin of the word "possible" has its roots in the concept of "one being made powerful, one who is now capable, one who is strong and mighty."  
	So here's the thing: Every situation in your life is meant to increase your power. It is meant to make you more anointed, more significant, and more capable. Why else would it be there? Somebody breathe\! Why else would it be there?   
	This whole notion is ridiculous that you have God on the one side who is for us, but the enemy can come in and do what he likes, and he can touch us, and he can affect us. When you are in Christ you are removed from the curse, and you are given power over the devourer. You are put in a place far above principalities and powers.   
	We are learning what that place looks like. Jesus' prayer was *on earth as it is in heaven.* So the same power, the same environment, the same atmosphere that exists in heaven can now come into your world and into your particular world. That is what we are looking at. That is Christianity 101, *on earth as it is in heaven.* We are not going to fall below the level of that glorious thing because it is not who we are.   
	We are Christians\! We are not to be messed with. We mess with people ourselves. We mess them up with the love of God, with the joy of God, with the peace of God because there is none of that in the world. You can mess the entire world up with love. You can mess the entire world up with laughter. You can mess the entire world up with your peace. You are an extraordinary being. You are a new creation. The world has never seen your like before Jesus, but now we exist in the world. And we are in many ways, spiritually, like the Anakim of old. We are giants in the land. We are warriors. We are champions. We are believers. We are followers of the Way. We are men and women of Jesus. We are filled with the Holy Spirit. DON'T MESS WITH US\!  
	We are the new giants on the block, and the world is our 'hood. The One that we follow is magnificent, and He is full of majesty and authority and power. And He does not deserve to be followed by a bunch of wimps. We are not wimps\! We are men and women of substance, and we are growing into our place. That is who we are. That is your truest identity. You are a son and a daughter of the Living God. No one better mess with you.   
	We are not angry. We are not judgmental. We are not unkind. We are not nasty. We are brilliant. We are loving. We are kind. We are generous. We are strong. We are passionate. We are gentle. We are peaceful. We are full of laughter, full of good cheer. We are generous, lavish, and we love a good fight. We will contend for what is ours, but we will contend with joy. We can run and not be weary. We can walk and not faint. This is who we are. We don't even need to sleep on days. We can get refreshed. We can go through deserts and the people following us will drink from out footprints. This is who we are. This is the nature of the people of God. This is what we represent: The best of Heaven here on earth. When Jesus comes back, it is not to rescue the church from the world. It is to rescue the world from us\!  
	We are a people group birthed in majesty and sovereignty. We have a passion. We cannot be overcome. We are overcomers. We are more than conquerors. We make the enemy think twice. We make him back off. We make him realize, "I can't win this fight. I'm backing off\!" This is who we are. This is our identity.   
	Everything is a possibility. Every single issue in your life is a possibility for something wonderful to occur. This is the art of thinking brilliantly, that we look at our life in such a way that everything is possible now. Now that I am learning how to really think, now that I am learning how to really be, everything is a possibility. Everything in my life is designed for my upgrade because God will use the enemy for my purposes. He said to the enemy, "For this reason, I have caused you to rise up that I might show My power in you."  
	Everything the enemy does, Jesus can joyfully overturn. And we are the people who are following that perspective. We know that somewhere in this situation there is an upgrade: I am being challenged by goodness. I am being challenged by God's goodness to rise up and see something that He is seeing and occupy that place, not just for myself, but for the people around me. Every one of my circumstances is going to make me more effective, more powerful. It's going to increase my strength. The majesty of God is going to come upon me in another layer of sovereignty.   
	Possibilities...everything is a possibility, and all the possibilities are for your empowerment. Never allow a situation to take something from you. It must yield something to you. That's why you are in Christ. That's why you are a believer. And so you are innately curious now, "What is going on here? I wonder what is going to yield to me in this situation?" You are intrigued, you are curious. You come before God in positive prayer saying, "I know You. You are up to something\! What's going on? Where is my upgrade here? What is it you are going to give me, not just for me but for the people  around me?"  
	If you are in a place of work and they are struggling in their business because their order book is low, you can go in early and start to pray. I have done this myself, gone into places and started to pray. Lord, this company can be blessed because I am here. So I will lay hands on the equipment, lay hands on everything, pray in every room. Lord, let the blessing of God come. Increase our order, increase our sales, in the name of Jesus.  
	A friend of mine was in prophetic ministry, and you know in the early days, in the '70s and '80s, ministry in England didn't, and still doesn't, actually pay well. They all think, "You're anointed. Get some money for yourself," which is okay. A friend of mine was in prophetic ministry, and he was living and nearly dying by faith. Here's the thing: If God isn't giving you money, He is giving you a way to make money. So I said this to my friend, "You know, if God isn't giving you money, He wants to give you an idea to make it."  
	So he went, "That sounds like God." So he went away to pray, and the Lord said to him, "I want you to open a business repairing office machinery, like photocopiers and stuff."   
	So he said, " Lord, I don't know anything about photocopiers."  
	And the Lord says, "Well, I do\!"  
	So he started this business. He got these leaflets and he went around town and he posted them an everything, and he got a call. A company was saying, "Our photocopier has broken down." He said, "Where are you? I'll be there in five minutes." And he walks in with his tool box, but there is nothing in the tool box except a three-by-two piece of card that just had on it his promise from God. So he would go in, he'd say, "Okay, show me where it is. Show me what's wrong. Okay," and he would get them to leave. He would close the door, and he would lay hands on it, and it would come back to life\! That's all he ever did. He was the first recorded appliance healer that I know\! That's all he ever did. He made tons of money, you know, but they said, "You are the fastest worker ever\!"  
	He said, "I know." So his reputation all around the town and the surrounding towns was, "This guy is a genius. He can make anything work\!" And guys would say to him, "Well, does a part need replacing?"  
	He said, "Oh, no, it's fine. You know I just massaged a few things."  
	They are all going, "How does he do it? We don't pay for parts, we just pay for labor."   
	That's funny\!  
	We have not yet discovered how ridiculous God wants to be on our behalf, how outrageous He loves to be on our behalf. All your circumstances are only about one thing. They are about you being empowered to see God, know God, flow with God, and develop a sense of wonder. I think that is what God is up to. The more difficult the circumstance, the more of a sense of wonder you are going to have when He does something brilliant. All you have to do is hang in there until the brilliance shows up. Only believe. That's your part, just believe. You know, just believe; it will work. "It will be cool. I will show up. You just believe. I'll be there."  
	What if all your circumstances are designed to give you a sense of wonder, to increase your sense of wonderment, "Oh my goodness, that was amazing\!" full of good cheer, full of laughter, loving problems because of what they bring to us, not scared of issues, not scared of problems or difficulties, seeing every one for what it is?   
	Some organizations have racked up a lot of problems and issues, and what they don't realize is they have also racked up an awful lot of blessings. There are upgrades stacked up over those organizations because they are not seeing things the way God sees it. They are seeing every problem as something to fight. Don't let the enemy distract you into warfare because if he distracts you into warfare, he can distract you away from your favor and away from your blessing. Always be asking the Lord, "Is this a fight You want us to have right now? Or should we just ignore it?" If you have problems stacked up, you also have upgrades stacked up because each problem was designed to give you an upgrade, so can we just shift our focus from the problem to the upgrade? Yeah, because God would love to give you stuff. Trust me.  
	We have power because we are established in Christ as a place of favor and promise. In this place all things are possible, everything is doable, everything is attainable. If we can conceive of something in our hearts, it can be realized in our experience. That is the lesson of life in the Spirit.   
	Israel was given a prophetic word in Egypt about deliverance from Egypt, and about entering the Promised Land. They knew the outcome. They saw the miracles. They received the wealth of coming out of Egypt, then something overcame all of that in the wilderness, and they started to take their eyes off God. Their eyes went off the promise, and they began to see the landscape around them and the environment around them, and they began to doubt, and doubt moved them to unbelief, and unbelief moved them into betrayal. They wanted to go back.   
	A promise shows you the outcome. The outcome is designed to increase your faith so that you engage with the process. Faith gives you imagination.   
	Here's the difficulty for many of us: We have been brought up in a world that only knows logic and reason. God gave us a great brain and wants us to use it. But there is a cutoff point where logic and reason are not going to help you in the realm of the Spirit. Now you need wisdom. Now you need revelation. Now you need imagination. You need dreams and you need to have visions so that you can cope with the majesty and the fullness and the abundance of what God wants to give you. There is a place, you hit a time where logic is no longer good enough. In fact, logic is a stumbling block because logic will talk you out of things that revelation would talk you into. I like logic and reason but only up to a point, and it's because I understand that Jesus is much too clever just to be an intellectual\!  
	Sometimes the world of the church has such an intellectual grasp on things. That is one of the chief reasons why it is powerless because we have to have understanding, so we don't bother to trust, so we don't move unless we understand something because we are so captured by logic and reason that we don't actually do anything. We don't do anything extraordinary, and we allow logic and reason and rationale to talk us out of spirituality so we allow the natural mind to talk us out of supernatural experience. Then to make ourselves feel good, we bring up this heresy that says, "Oh well, all these things were just to get the early church started, but now we don't need them anymore because we've got the Bible," and we have actually allowed ourselves to be steered by the enemy into a place where we are utterly powerless to affect what the enemy is trying to do in the world.   
	And then we do things like we turn to politics to actually try and upgrade the deficit that we feel is around our lives. Nothing against politics, nothing against Christians in politics, but it's not the total answer. The total answer is for the church to come back into the realm of walking with Jesus in such a glorious way that everything is a possibility that our identity rises up and it's greater than anything that is coming against us and we begin to discover who we really are in Jesus and what our rightful place is in the earth. We are happy to submit to governments and so on, but we are also going to pray them into a higher place of being, and we are going to affect and infiltrate them, not just by going up against them politically, though that is a part of the battle. I understand that. But it's also about going into those places and walking around and saying, "This territory is mine because I serve the one, true, great, original territorial Spirit, and His name is Jesus, and all the earth belongs to Him, and this place belongs to Him. He is Lord. He is sovereign. He is going to be Lord in this situation, in these circumstances, and we have come to fight in His name, and you cannot resist us because He has already been to your place for three days. It took Him just three days to wipe you guys out, and you guys couldn't hold Him there. In His weakened state, He could still beat you. And then He came out with everything He wanted to come out with, and you couldn't stop Him. He rose again from the dead, and now He occupies everything, and we are His representatives. We are His ambassadors. We are His warriors, and we joyfully serve, and we are as He is. In Him we live, we move, we have our being."   
	Now that's a mindset\! That is the mindset that God wants us to have. A mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, life and peace in everything.  
	Faith gives you imagination so that you can overcome logic and rational by giving you a vision for what God is permitting. A promise takes us away from Egypt and moves us towards Canaan. It's a guaranteed outcome that empowers us to make the journey with confidence. Of all people on the face of the earth, you are the most confident. Why? Because you already know the outcome. It's like being one of the teams in the super bowl, and you already know that you win before you even get out there. You still have to get out there and play the game, but you are going to play it with a smile on your face because, "Suckers\! We know who is going to win\!"  
	The Father loves impossibilities. He loves stepping into our inadequacy and our insecurity to offer Himself and make His intentions clear. He is the most intentional person I have ever met in my entire life. "I will be with you, and you shall defeat Midian as one man, Gid\!" Here is Gideon hiding away in a winepress making bread, like you do when you're depressed\! And then God shows up and says, "I've called you to be a champion\! Hey, valiant man\!"  
	And Gideon is going, "Dude\! Wear some glasses next time\! You calling me valiant? I don't feel valiant\!"  
	"I don't care what you feel like, son. When I look at you, I see a valiant man."  
	You see, here's the thing about the love of God: He gets right in your face, and He tells you, "Yeah, away with all your excuses, this is how I see you. This is who you are."  
	"Yeah, but I can't do that\!"  
	"Yeah, I know. But this is who you are."  
	"But I'm no good at this\!"  
	"Yeah, I know. But this is who you are."  
	"But I'm the youngest in my father's house\!"  
	"Yeah, I know. But this is who you are."  
	"And my tribe is the poorest\! My family is the poorest in our whole tribe\!"  
	"I know\!"  
	"I can't do this\!"  
	"I know\! You're perfect\!"  
	"I'm useless as it is\!"  
	"Why do you think I chose you? Everyone is going to know that if Gideon does this, there is a God in Israel\! There are no excuses\! There are no reasons\! Just show up and take orders\! I will be with you."  
	He just gives you the "N" word: Nevertheless... Which is a polite way of saying, "I have listened to all you said, and now I am ignoring it."  
	Here's the thing: A promise is designed to deal with doubt and fear and unbelief. Your promise is the antidote to all of that.  
	So you're saying, "I don't know if I can do it\!"  
	And God says, "I gave you a promise. Did you pick up your promise? I gave you a promise, right? Yeah, I thought I did. You got a promise, right? There you go then. You have a promise, Dude\! Brilliant\!"  
	Your promise is the antidote to doubt, fear, and unbelief. It's like, "Thank God, I've got a promise\! Hang on a minute\! Why am I panicking? I've got a promise\! Sheesh\! I've got a prophecy\! I've got a verse of Scripture the Holy Spirit gave me about six months ago. Ah, saved\!"  
	Jesus said with people it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God. Every single thing in your life is one thing: It's a possibility. It's a possibility for something amazing to happen. It's a possibility for you to be upgraded, increased, receive fullness, receive abundance. It's a possibility for you to overcome, rise up, occupy a new place, that in the current difficulty there is some territory for you that God has marked out on your behalf.   
	"Graham, the reason I love this problem is because it's got territory attached to it that I want to give to you. Don't look at the problem\! Let's put the problem on one side. See the territory\! Yeah, there are a few tribes in it to be sure, and one or two giants, but nothing you can't handle because I am with you." Guys going through the wilderness, all they saw was, "They've got giants in the land\! They have swords and chariots\!"  
	And God says, "Granted there are a few interesting items. Granted it's not going to be a cake walk. But, hey, listen, I will be there, and we only have to win the first few fights, and then the terror of Me will fall on everyone. It will be so cool you will love it\!"   
	A promise covers everything, every eventuality, then they arise. You know this is the Gospel, right? This is the glad tidings of great joy that Heaven is restored to earth, and now on earth has been birthed a whole new race of people who can interact with Heaven out of their pleasure, and that's you. The Gospel is such incredible good news, it borders on fantasy. We know that when something is too good to be true in the world, someone is about to be conned. But in the Kingdom, if it's not too good to be true, it's not God. It's not God because He is so brilliant, so outrageous, so amazing, so lavish, so generous, so powerful, so full of sovereignty and majesty. Everything represents the excellence of Jesus. Every circumstance you are in has a possibility for greatness, and for greatness to emerge in you, not just in your resolutions, but in you yourself personally. A promise covers everything. It is the intention of God made tangible, "I gave you a promise\! It will be great\! Trust Me\!"  
	You know, God loves to work in us so that He can delight in what He conceives. When He sees a situation that you are in, He sees it with a grin on His face because He knows what He wants to do. It's like, "I know. I have sent Graham a really interesting problem, and I'm really hoping that boy just wakes up and sees all the possibilities. But we might have to give him a nudge because he is a bit slow in the morning\!"  
	He delights in the situations you are in because He knows what He has already conceived of that He wants to give you. Every problem comes with a provision attached to it. Every promise is designed to see you come into fullness. He makes the unthinkable become imaginable. What is beyond the bounds of possibility is now, in Christ, brought within reach. All things are possible. Everything. Your life is full of possibilities. Your organization is not full of problems. It is full of possibilities. Prophecies, visions, dreams take us into the realms of God's intention, into the realms of God's impossibilities, and He makes all those things possible.   
	Some things that God has planned for us seem impossible for us. But He is saying, "No, even My impossibilities are possible for you."  
	Well, how is that going to happen? "How will that be?" Mary said. It seemed impossible for her.   
	God said, "I will make it possible. Even the impossibilities you see, in Me, I will make possible."   
	That's why just listening to David last night, this is a man who is steeped in a possibility. It's like, he is going to have half a dozen different ideas every day before breakfast. Do you sense that in him? I really sensed a kindred spirit in that man. You know, he's one of us\! Well, hopefully we can be one of him\!  
	But it's like everything is a possibility. You know you've got favor when people start ringing you up and saying, "Can I give you stuff?" That was cool\!  
	Prophecy, vision, and dreams help us bypass the natural mindset with its overreliance on rationale, logic, and reason, and the need to understand everything before we make a decision. Proverbs 3:5-6 says *Don't lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Me. Trust in the Lord with all your heart.* Don't lean on your own understanding. It's not going to be helpful to you, but where you don't understand, trust.   
	Here's the problem in many of us: We have replaced trust with logic and understanding. We have a need to understand, and what we don't realize is that trust replaces our need to understand. "I don't know what's happening, Lord. I just trust You, though. I don't need to lean on my own understanding here. I have not got a clue how it's going to work out, but I know You. I know You, I trust You."  
	Don't ever replace trust with logic. It's not cool. Prophecy, dreams, and vision are part of the principles of faith where we learn to trust the Lord with all our heart. Walking by faith is moving in God's intent. We are discovering the intentions of God, and then we are aligning ourselves with them, and as we trust, we move from the impossible to the possible. When we don't know, we trust. When we hear God, we need to move in faith. A promise is the language of love. It reveals the determination of God to us.   
	So here's the thing: What if every circumstance is loaded with upgrades? It's like you buy a car these days, and it comes loaded with upgrades, and you are sitting in there and you are pressing this and pulling that, and "This is cool, and I like this. And whoa\! That's brilliant\! I like that\! I mean, I can press this thing and a voice will tell me where to go? Hope she's polite\!"  
	Isn't that the most annoying sound with the sat-nav? "Recalculating\!" Wonder if sat-navs talk to each other? "My driver is an idiot\! If it wasn't for me, he would never get anywhere. If it wasn't for me, he never would have got that job because he would have been late for the interview\! If it wasn't for me, that child would have been born in a lay-by, not in a hospital\!"I have no idea where that came from, but I am so blaming the Lord\!  
	What if every circumstance is loaded with upgrades in your relationship with God? I wonder how many of us in the circumstances we are facing have really received an upgrade in our relationship with God because of it?   
	All your circumstances have to bring a gift. Why? You belong to Jesus. If you are in Christ all your circumstances are in Christ as well so your circumstances have to bring you a gift. They have to bring a release into your life because you are in the Kingdom now. You are subject to a different level of sovereignty. Nothing can bring you down, but everything can take you up. You are a Kingdom person, and it's time we started behaving in a Kingdom way, thinking in a Kingdom way. "I am a Kingdom person. This has to bow the knee. I am going to stay standing until this situation yields to me what God wants me to have, and I am not being moved away from my hope in the Gospel."   
	That is a mindset. It is a mind-set, a mind set on the Spirit is life and peace. David was a man after God's own heart because he said, "My heart is fixed, oh God, my heart is fixed." That's it.   
	What if every circumstance is loaded with upgrades in terms of faith, authority, identity, fruit of the Spirit, blessings, favor? What if difficulties and problems and circumstances are meant to continue your walk of happiness and joy? What if they are not meant to deprive you of the fruit of the Spirit? What if they are meant to increase the fruit of the Spirit? So a problem increases your joy and your peace. It increases your sense of being beloved, and you know that if a problem lasts for a few months, it's just about you getting an upgrade in patience.  
	I had a situation that really was about an upgrade in patience. This situation ran for seven months. I stored up enough patience for a small company of people\!   
	Here's the thing: About six months after that, I hit this battle that went on for five months unrelenting every single day, battle, warfare, and I used up all the patience. I so totally won\! I took advantage be cause my patience allowed me to do so. I had enough patience stored up, I beat the enemy every day by being patient, and I came out of that conflict, you know, I didn't become negative. I stayed in Christ. I won a bigger victory, I am convinced, because I had all that patience. I came out of it with new friends. I came out of it with upgrades in the Spirit. I came out of it with some cash, and all I did was use the patience I had stored up. Kind of figured that God knows what He's doing.  
	Here's a question: Have you inherited everything you should have in your present circumstances? Then you need to go looking. You need to go on a treasure hunt. What upgrades are supposed to be yours right now? What is the next phase of your inheritance? What are you inheritance words?  
	You know, we need to understand how God loves to use Scripture. I personally don't think that God minds if you don't read through the Bible in a year. I think probably He would encourage you not to do it because He doesn't want to be as bored as you are going to be\! Because you know what it's like. You start off with good intentions, and three months into the year you are fourteen chapters behind, and you are starting to feel guilty, and then condemned, and He's looking at you saying, "I never asked you to do that anyway. I have never read through the Bible in one year\!" It's like I tried to do it once, you know, because I wanted to know what it felt like, and it was a battle that I really shouldn't have been in. I was four chapters into Leviticus, and the Lord said, "What are you doing?"  
	I said, "I'm trying to read Leviticus."  
	And He said, "Why?"  
	It's like, you know, Leviticus is a camping memo. It's all about tents and pomegranates. When I go camping I want this kind of tent, I want this kind of covering, I want this kind of floor covering, I want a barbecue in the corner, I want a hammock...it's a camping memo, with fruit in it\!  
	I am so far away from my point, I need a plane to get back\!  
	Oh, I know what the point was\! Thank You\! Saved\! Yes\! He loves me.  
	How God uses Scripture. There is point to my madness this morning, I assure you.  
	God loves to open up Scripture and choose the passage that He wants you to live in now. How many of us have had those moments when Scripture has just jumped off the page and wrapped itself around your face? You know it\! It's like you are excited, your heart is going, and your spirit is alive, and you know that God is talking to me. Well, He wasn't giving you a passage to memorize or study, though you could do those things and that would be cool. He was actually giving you a promise for your life. He was giving you your inheritance word.   
	When God gives you a passage of Scripture, what He is saying to you is, "Everything in this passage belongs to you. It's yours. You need to study it because you need to find out everything I want to give you. Every experience, every encounter in that passage, you are meant to have that experience and those encounters. Every promise in that passage now belongs to you. Everything I do in power in that passage, I will do in your life. It is your inheritance word."  
	So Jesus walks into His hometown church, and He walks up to the front, and He takes the scroll from the attendant, and normally they read in sequence so they start this week where they left off last week. The Bible says that *He found the place*  so the Savior read out of sequence in church\! In the church I grew up in it's like that is a reason for the elders to come and anoint you\!  
	So He found the place where it said, and He begins to read out Isaiah 61, *The Spirit of the sovereign Lord has anointed Me.* What is He doing? He is reading out His inheritance word. "This is who I am. All these things I can do because I am anointed to do them. This is My inheritance word. It belongs to Me, and I am going to become it. I am going to be the living embodiment of it."  
	So, how many people have had Scripture given into their life by God? Check it out\! How many have got more than one? How many have got six? More than six? You have got your inheritance word. You need to look at that word like you would study prophecy. Everything in it is yours. If there is a person's name mentioned in there, you can have the same identity and the same relationship with God. When God gave me Numbers 13 and 14, He started talking to me about Caleb, and He said, "I have called you to be a Caleb. I want you to swim against the tide. I want you to be a man of a different spirit. I want you to see things that can't be seen. I want you to relish the fight. I want you to love the presence of a giant because you know I will always be bigger. I have called you to be that person."  
	So if there is a person's name in it, you get to become that person\! So guys, if you have got a verse with Ruth's name in it, good luck with that one\! I'm just kidding, maybe\! Maybe it means you are meant to love your wife like Ruth was loved. There is always an application.  
	But God gives you Scripture. Who hasn't had a Scripture like that? Who hasn't had that experience? Stand up\! Let's pray for you right now\! Come on, stand up, stand up, stand up\! Oh my gosh\! Score\! Come on, there's bound to be a few more\! Yeah, come on\! Stand up\! You're not British. You don't have any of that reserve, like I do. Okay, people around them, lay hands on them. Let's pray\!

	In the name of Jesus, I declare to you that you are now going to attract dreams, vision, prophecy, Scripture. God is going to connect with you. If you are listening right now, if you are watching this right now and you are not here, and you have not had a prophecy in your life, and you have not had a Scripture in your life or a dream or a vision, I declare to you in the name of Jesus you are so not getting away with it\! In Jesus' name, I declare God will speak to you. He will come to you. He will envision you. You will have dreams and visions. Someone is going to pick you out for a prophetic word. The word of God is going to come alive to you. God is going to release Scripture into your life, and when He does, He is going to be excited, and He is going to be saying, "This is who you are. Everything in this now belongs to you, and now in this promise, now you can learn to be in alignment with Me in Jesus' name."   
	It is not about you trying to get something, it is about you being peaceful and just receiving it. It is going to come, you can't stop it. In the name of Jesus we proclaim it over you for the sake of Jesus, and for the sake of your role and your place in the Kingdom. Amen\! Cool\!

	Bonus\!  
	Here's the thing: Believing the impossible is not about the suspension of disbelief, you know, persuading people to believe in the unrealistic. It is actually the reverse of that. It is the normalizing of the improbable. It is the humanizing of the giant. It is cutting a negative down into manageable proportions. You don't win if you don't expect to win. So defeat is the unthinkable thinkable. That's why you need a new mindset. Defeat is never a possibility. Everything is an invitation from God. Your part is to trust in the promise, enjoy His presence, obey the promptings of the Spirit, focus on Him relationally.   
	In Christ we are learning to upgrade the way we look at problems. Mostly we've learned to look at issues and try to handle the negativity of something or someone. We are trying to resolve an issue. That is the standard practice.   
	What if the real issue with a problem person is not their current behavior, but it is the fact that their identity in Christ needs to be upgraded? When you look at a person as a problem, you are missing something, and you will treat them negatively. We need to look at problems not from the deficit that is present, but from the promise that is also present, from the perspective of the promise, the prophecies, and the word that God has spoken over that person.   
	Accountability is always about freedom. Sometimes my question to somebody is, "What is it that you are believing about yourself that makes you think this behavior is okay? Your behavior right now is nasty. But I don't want to focus on the nastiness of your behavior. I want to focus on your identity because something is causing you to do this. You are seeing yourself in a way that is not helpful, and that's the manifestation of it. What is it you are believing about yourself that makes you think that this behavior is okay?"  
	It is always an issue of identity. When we are overly negative it is time for an upgrade in our identity. If we are still being anxious, we need an upgrade in our identity. If our first response to an issue is to worry or panic, we need an upgrade in our identity. Everything is about identity.   
	Who are you? Who do you want to be? What on earth do you think the circumstance is here for? It is here to take you from who you are now to who you are supposed to be next, and your problem is the vehicle. So how you see it, don't see it as a deficit, but see it as a promise. See it as a possibility. This situation has to take me somewhere in Christ.  
	The question is how can this problem trigger my provision? That's a good question. What is my inheritance in this matter?   
	We look at issues through the nature of God. That is the only way to look at it, through the lens of goodness. We look at life from the perspective of our promises, not our problems, and we counsel people from their promises into their breakthroughs. We pastor people from prophetic words that reveal their next level of persona, identity, and destiny. Sometimes the antidote to your past is not your present being sorted out, it is your future being determined.   
	Do you want me to say that in English? Alright.  
	Sometimes the antidote to your past is not your present being sorted out, it is your future being determined. God is present-future.   
	A common mistake is that we look at issues through the threat language and the posture it creates for us. It's like we get on the back foot, you know. So we are not leaning into God when a problem comes. We are on the back foot. We are looking at it through the threat language, either of the people or the situation itself. And sometimes we can look at problems thru the historic expenditure that these situations usually have cost us. "Oh great. That's all I need." Why? Because all you are imagining right now is "It's going to hard, it's going to be tough," and so you set out with this problem and you are already tired. "That's all I need right now. It never rains but it pours\!" so you are already undoing yourself.  
	We become tired at the beginning before we even tackle the thing. And a lot of the time we don't tackle it, we procrastinate. We put it off because "it's just going to wear me out, it's going to make me tired, and you know what? I just can't take another battle, can't take another upheaval, can't take another confrontation. I'm tired, I'm fed up." You have so beaten yourself.   
	It is your privilege to be refreshed, to have a mindset that energizes you, that doesn't suck away your energy, your passion. Jesus said, *Come to Me all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.* Rest is a weapon against the enemy. I practice my rest every single day. Every single day without fail, I practice my rest. I live in peace. I can't remember the last time I was anxious about something.   
	Peace is your right. Rest is your right. Joy is your right. The problems that we face are sent to increase us in all those things. That is just a part of the benefit package. You remember, every issue that presents itself is never the real issue. It is the issue behind the issue, and the issue behind the issue is that everything is about relationship with Jesus. So you take that issue out of the way, then you can see this first thing: "It's about me and You. What does this mean for you and I, Papa? What does it mean for our relationship?"   
	So you upgrade your relationship, and then when you come to look at the problem, suddenly you find yourself above it, you are not underneath it. Now you're above it, you've got some power over it. Now you are intrigued. Now you are in a place where you can hear God, you can respond to God, you can obey God, and the favor starts to rise up in you. Trust is already present. This is everything is possible with God because your whole relationship has gone to another level, and it's gone to the level now of possibility.  
	Unless you upgrade your relationship with God first, the problem will overwhelm you. So never make the issue the real issue. The real issue is always your relationship with God first. Then we can be released to partner with God in all the possibilities, and we are not dejected by our impossible circumstances, but we are energized by the possibilities of God. Christ within means that we have access to the Creator within, and we get to create with Him the life we want to lead in the Spirit. You always end up with the life that you created, good or bad. So make it a good one\!   
	We are learning to break out of our failure patterns, you know, the things that we are convinced we are no good at. When you engage with God's intentionality, you grow up in Christ. You take responsibility for your blessings. We step into a stronger relationship with the Lord. It's time to step out of the shadow of our own inadequacy and insecurity, and cheer up\! He has already overcome the world. You are part of the overcoming.   
	It's always our unrealized potential that brings us most pain. It's the violence of mediocrity that holds us hostage to a poverty spirit. You know, mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it.   
	Our circumstances are not the problem. Our perception of our circumstances is the problem. We think of circumstances only in the context of the difficulties they contain. God sees them in the context of the provisions that He has made available. Every situation is relational first. It is about you being changed, then it's about the situation being resolved.   
	The joy of promise is that it creates encounter. A promise is designed to create encounter. That is the pleasure of having one. It's where we engage with God. We engage with God with the promise, not with the problem. You know the outcome. Now you have the pleasure of working with the promise in the process. But I am going down this road knowing what the outcome is going to be. I am excited. I'm interested. Why? Because I am going to experience the possibility becoming a reality.  
	  
	Let's pray.

	Father, I thank You. You are so excited. You love us. You are so thrilled to be part of our life. That's a sign and a wonder to us. You are so thrilled to be with us. How amazing it is to walk with You. I want to thank You for the level of peace in this room right now, that You have disturbed all our anxieties, and You have made us thrilled with Yourself, that You have taken our worries and our fears, and You have caused them to disappear, and now suddenly, wonderfully, trust is back. We trust You. We trust You. We trust You. We trust You. We trust You. We trust You.  
	You are with us. We will succeed. We will overcome because of the sheer power and strength of Your intention towards us. We can see clearly now. We can see clearly. Everything is about a possibility. All things are possible.   
	We are learning about our own authority, that all things must bow to us. All things must yield to the intention of God, and we are learning about how precious we are, how vital we are, how important we are in You plans and Your purposes.   
	So I take authority over any residue of fear, anxiety, worry, panic, unbelief, doubt. I bind it. I curse it in the name of Jesus, and I command it to loose its hold and to leave us, in Jesus' name. And I declare in Jesus' name, there is no despair, there is only goodness. You would have despaired unless you had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, so I declare I curse despair in the name of Jesus, and I command goodness to rise up in your heart, in your thinking, in your situation, in your circumstances. I command goodness to flow towards you.   
	I declare to you in Jesus' name, all of Heaven is attracted to the Jesus in you. All of Heaven is attracted to the Jesus in you. And the Jesus in you can receive under pressure. You can become the man or the woman that God has wanted you to be, that He intends you to be. You are more beautiful than you know. You are more powerful than you realize, and you can do all things in Christ because He will so strengthen you with Himself.   
	So I bless you in the name of Jesus, and I declare to you that you are now free to move about the land of possibilities, and every time you get a problem, you are going to hear that "Ding\! You are now free to move about the land of possibilities\!" You are  going to hear that as a "Ding\!"and we are going to encourage each other, "What's the possibility? What's the intention of God? What is God doing?"   
	There is an upgrade here. Let's go looking for it. We are on a treasure hunt. We are not looking for problems, we are looking for treasure. We are looking for upgrades. We are looking for possibilities. We are looking for sovereignty, majesty. But we are looking to upgrade our relationship. Let's upgrade our relationship in that\! Cool\!  
	Use the problem. Don't be used by it.   
	So I bless you in Jesus' name. You are living in the land of possibilities. 	Have fun\! Enjoy yourself\! Amen.

	Thanks for listening. I appreciate it\!

DISC 6

	Let's just bless the Holy Spirit one last time, eh? Just in your own heart, why don't you just tell Him, you know, like three reasons why you love Him?  
	Holy Spirit, You are so good, so strong, so majestic, so intentional, so funny, so powerful, so loving, so gracious, so generous, and You are a genius at life. You really know how to live life to the full. You know how to enjoy everything. You don't endure anything; You enjoy everything. You are astonishing\! You are our helper. You are our comforter, great trainer. Thank You.   
	Thank You for all that You do. Just receive the silent appreciation of our hearts, and we invite You again to do what You are so brilliant at, connecting us to the heart of the Father and opening up the Kingdom to us.   
	So we bless You. We bless Your authority. We bless Your ministry to us, but we bless Your relationship with us, too. And we ask that we would go from strength to strength in our knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the key role that You play in our lives in making us like Jesus. Amen.  
	  
	We have the same relationship with the Father that Jesus has in heaven. That's why we are put into Christ in the first place. That's what it means to become Christ-like. We become like Him in all the ways that He is, in His thinking, in His perception, in His language, in the way He moves out of His heart, in the way that He is just so full of wisdom and grace and mercy and kindness, in the power that He displays in the earth, and the authority that is in His name. In all things we are becoming Christ-like, but especially, too, in the area of being a joint heir with Him in the things of God.   
	A Christian is a person who cannot contemplate a day without favor. That's our identity. Ha\! Not even going to go there\! Can't contemplate a day without favor. It's a divine advantage to be in Jesus. Not only that, you must see it this way: It is your birthright to live in favor. You are birthed into favor. You are birthed into intentionality. You are birthed into promise. You are birthed into divine advantage. It is your birthright. It is a special privilege that comes to us not because of our performance as believers, but because of our placement in Jesus. All favor is already attached to you. So nudge your neighbor and say, "I can see favor sticking up on your shoulder\!"  
	Some people are going, "I can see favor, and it looks like it's got blonde hair and lipstick\!"  
	Listen, you don't have a chip on your shoulder, you have favor. All favor is attached to the new true you in Christ. It is not attached to the old you in the flesh, which actually is dead. God has not attached favor to a corpse\! He has attached it to the new life in Jesus that is you, the new true you in Christ. And God gives us permission to consider ourselves dead and to be alive to Him, Romans 6:11, and favor is attached. It is part of that sense of being alive to God. You are alive to all the possibilities, and you are alive to the favor that is now part of you because it is your birthright.   
	So it's like when you are born again, you know when a child is born, what do we all do? We all go look at the face and everything, "Yeah, well, he's got his dad's nose, and his mother's eyes," and we kind of dissect the face. "Oh, he looks totally like his dad\!"   
	We were all doing it when Penelope Violet was born three weeks ago, my third grandchild. She is just so gorgeous, and we're all doing it, "Looks like Mark\!" 	"Well, I think she looks a bit like Sophie at the bridge of her nose..." and we're all doing it. What are we doing? We are looking for likeness. We are looking for similarity.   
	Here's the thing: When you were  born again, you were born again with a likeness that is now being established. It's not like, "Well, I am this person, and I'm trying to become like this one." No, I am born again. Therefore, I am already like this person. I am just growing up into that identity.   
	We have our Father's likeness right now. What we are doing is we are abiding in that, and it's growing up in us, and we are growing up into all things in Christ. But you are already in the likeness of God because you are born again, and it is your birthright.   
	Nudge your neighbor and say, "You look so like Jesus to me\!"  
	The great thing is, the beauty is we have all got aspects of His personality, we have all got aspects of who He is, so when we come together in a crowd, Jesus is always more than the sum of our parts. So when we come together, when we assemble together, we are assembling our identity together as a corporate man. And that's the beauty of all of us. We have a birthright right now. We are in the likeness of God right now, and we are learning what that looks like.   
	So favor is attached to who you are in Jesus. God deals with your negatives in the context of showing you your identity in Jesus. That 's why God always says, whenever you come up with an excuse God will always say, "Nevertheless...I understand all of that but it's actually irrelevant to Me. I appreciate it's got a measure of relevance to you because you feel emotionally attached to your own pessimism, but actually it's got no relevance to Me because this is how I see you, and I'm not going to take into account all of that stuff because this is how I see you. Nevertheless, I will be with you." What He is saying is, "I am your identity in this situation."   
	So as you are born again in Christ, you already have the identity that you need for the lifestyle that God wants you to have. What you are learning in every problem, difficulty, and situation, and circumstance is how to grow the identity that is really you.   
	So everything is useful. That's why you can't contemplate a day without favor because you are already a son and a daughter of Heaven. You are favored whether you like it or not. You are favored whether you encounter it or not, whether you believe for it or not, whether you stand up for it or not, whether you expect it or not. It doesn't alter the fact that favor is a part of your life. Get used to it\!  
	When God puts His finger on a part of your life that is not working, He is showing you the upgrade that He already has for you in that area. He is pointing to the site of your next miracle. The Holy Spirit is saying, "Let's do some great stuff in that area\!" God doesn't point out your shortcomings for any sense of condemnation or guilt or conviction even. What He is doing is He is saying to you, "When I put My finger on there, I am declaring that you can invite Me into that place and I will come and do a miracle."  
	There is conviction for you in the sense of, "I am convinced that God is actually going to do something brilliant in that area."   
	It's time we stop hiding from our faults and started profiting from them. It's time we stop stepping away from change and everything. It's time we stopped avoiding God, and it's time we stepped into the blessing of God. All of us have got things in our life we would like to get rid of. That should be a 'Yahoo\!' moment for you\! It's not a problem because you don't want those things anyway, and it's not a problem for God. When He puts His finger on a part of your life that is not working, He is inviting Himself into that space to do something, to give you a miracle, to give you a provision, to show you your identity, and to show you the provision that He has always had planned for that part of your life.   
	That's why change should be glorious because we are changing from one degree of glory into another. Remember goodness and glory are always inseparable so you are changing from one degree of goodness into another one. All change in you is beautiful. When God is changing you, He is making you into Jesus. Therefore, change is glorious because it has glory attached to it.   
	So don't avoid change, run towards it\! It is a good moment. When the Father puts His finger on something, you should be wriggling like a little puppy just at the thought, you know, like a little Labrador faced with a pile of bacon or something\!  
	You know the story, God gave Labradors a brain but they ate it\! Labradors love food. They will eat anything. Don't leave stuff laying around\!  
	We should face change like a little puppy wriggling with pleasure at the thought of food. That is who we are. We love change\! We embrace change. We are happy with change. Why? Because I want to move up from glory into glory.  
	It always amazes me, those people who say, "Well, how are you doing?" and it's like (spoken glumly), "Well, the Lord is really changing me."  
	And you're going, "That's a good thing, right?"  
	Or you get those guys who say, "Well, you know, God was really after me with His grace, you know, for the last three months and I have finally given in\!"  
	I'm thinking, "That's your testimony?\! You plank\! It took you three months to give into grace?\! You pelican\! That's your testimony?\! Sheesh\!"  
	The enemy wants to point to your shortcomings to make you feel condemned. God never does that. He doesn't do condemnation. He doesn't do that. He points to those things to say, "I want to invade that area, and I've got something to give you. Let Me in."  
	You can only overcome a negative by replacing it with something better. When God points to a negative, He has got something to put in its place. You know, the Gospel is an exchange mechanism. God wants to take that and give you this. You don't become a new person by changing your behavior. You discover the person you already are in Christ and behave accordingly.  
	Do you want me to say that in English?  
	You don't become a new person by changing your behavior. You discover the person you already are in Jesus, and you behave accordingly. You are dead to sin. You are alive to righteousness. You can be righteous any time you like.   
	You can go through life saying, "I don't have to do that because I am righteous. I have the righteousness of God in Christ. I am righteous, and the Holy Spirit is in me and He is teaching me to be holy, and I'm loving it\!"  
	Let me read you the Bible. I know, I can hardly contain myself\! Philemon, (this wasn't a letter, it was more of a postcard) verse 6, *And I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you in Christ.* That is so good, I am going to read it again. *I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you in Christ.*  
	Knowledge in the Bible is not about what you know. It's about what you have experienced. All knowledge in the Bible is linked to experience. God doesn't want you memorizing Scripture. He wants you becoming the living embodiment of it. The Bible is not there to collect memory verses. It is there so that you can become established in the truth, and the truth can set you free.  
	It's amazing to me how much energy we spend dealing with a negative. The enemy wants you to think that your flesh is still alive, and God wants you to consider it dead. Who are you going to go with? He wants you to consider it dead so that you can concentrate on being alive in Him.   
	I was talking to a guy in St. Paul a few weeks ago. He said to me, "Will you pray for me? I really need to deal with my anger problem."  
	So I looked at him and I said, "No." I was thinking, why would I want to pray about a negative, when I can pray about a positive? What he is doing is he is coming and this is his confession, "This is who I am."  
	I said, "Dude, this is not who you are. What I want you to do is, I am going to pray for you right now that God will just touch you, and I want you to think about what would be the equivalent to anger that God wants you to become, and when you know that, come back to me and I'll make sure you get it."  
	So the next day he came back and he said, "Well, I have thought about it and I really feel like the Lord wants to give me gentleness."  
	And I said, "Yeah. So I will pray for your gentleness then because that is the antidote."   
	What he is saying is, "Can you help me with my anger problem?"  
	"Well, your anger problem is in a grave somewhere."  
	Do you understand what I'm saying here? Your anger problem was nailed to a tree, then it was taken down and put in a tomb, and when Jesus was resurrected, He didn't take it with Him\! He didn't want it, either\!  
	So now we pray for a replacement. We spend too much energy dealing with a negative when all of our attention should be on dealing with the positive. If God were to come and say, "I want to take that anger and give you gentleness," that is what He would be doing. "So I will pray for you for gentleness, and you focus on being gentle. The consequence of that will be you will stop being angry."  
	Do you get that principle? You don't become a new person by changing your behavior. You discover the person you already are in Christ, gentle, and you become that. You focus on that, and so your confession then is not "I have an anger problem."  Your confession is, "I am a gentle man. I am a gentle person." And then you practice gentleness, and you are going to have all the same opportunities to be gentle that you had previously to be angry. But now you are practicing gentleness instead because it's a fruit of the Spirit, and it is who you really are.  
	What if the real issue for this guy is not that he is displaying anger, but that he is resisting the grace to be gentle? What if all your negatives are dead, and the real problem is that you have not yet replaced them with something wonderful in Jesus? That deserves more than a golf clap because that is your inheritance\!   
	That is your inheritance. You have got to keep focused on who you really are in Christ. All your negatives are dead, and our problem is we have not yet replaced them with something wonderful in Christ.   
	I did a talk on that whole thing of the power of 'instead,' "Turning Passivity into Prophecy" and the whole thing of looking at a negative and then thinking, "What is the opposite of that?" and then focusing on that. That is your inheritance. That is the mind of Christ. That is a brilliant way of thinking. "Well, okay, the opposite of that is this, so I appreciate that, but this is what I'm focusing on."  
	This is where the enemy helps us. He doesn't like it. He can't avoid it. He is a victim of it. He has to support the work of God. He hates that about himself that he has no choice because he has been disempowered by Jesus to do what He wants to do, and now he has to fulfill the will of God. "For this person I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you," he has no choice about that, and he hates himself for it. That's just so much fun\! He has to help you. So when he shows up with a negative, you are going to say, "Ah\! Okay, appreciate that. The opposite of that is this; okay, you can go now because I know what I have to focus on."  
	Favor plays a critical part in the development of your new nature in Christ. Favor in Christ empowers your freedom from sin into a place of establishing the righteousness of God. Your favor enables you to overcome yourself, then your circumstances, and anything demonic that gets in your way. Favor empowers you to overcome your own history. It enables you to overcome your own failure system that you grew up with. It enables you to escape from that and actually become somebody else. But all the negatives that the enemy will choose to violate you with, you are not violated by them anymore, you are saying, "Okay, appreciate that. The opposite of that is ta-da\! Okay, I am so going for you\!" and it becomes a joy\! We are never going to be condemned by the enemy, unless we are dumb, which I think we are not\!  
	Favor enables you to cultivate your identity in the process of being set free and discovering who Jesus is for you. Everything in your life is a joy. Make it so, Number One\! Make it so\! Make it a joy. *Count it all as joy*. You know, look up all the things in your life right now, and they are all the reasons to be joyful. *Count it all joy.* Everything. Why? Because of who God is and because of what He is doing in your heart and in your life.  
	We are in the Kingdom\! We are in the Kingdom of light. We are not in the Kingdom of darkness. We are not walking around playing blind man's bluff. We are in the Kingdom. We are in the light. Let's walk as children of light. You have got enough light to see the brilliance of God that He wants to bring into your life through this situation right now.  
	The Gospel is so incredible. Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil because God was with Him. As He is, so are you in this world.  
	Favor is brilliant in empowering us in the process of being Christ-like. Favor is not just about overcoming a negative. It's about actually taking advantage of it. Wouldn't that be fun to take advantage of every negative thing? Someone says something nasty, and you get a blessing from God. Someone persecutes you and a spirit of glory and of God rests on you. You are walking around like a drunk saying, "Dude, thanks\! Don't know what you did, but it was great\! Thanks for that horrible word, it really blessed me\! Appreciate it\!"  
	Do you know what an enigma that makes you? Come on, being an enigma is fun\! Who wants to be ordinary? Who wants to be one of the crowd? You are a standout person. You are in Jesus. You are an enigmatic person\!   
	"Dude, you cursed me\! Appreciate it because Jesus has already taken care of every curse, so I have permission to turn that curse into a blessing\! I am so going to work on it\! Thanks for the homework\! Love it\!"  
	Love that\!  
	One of my favorite experiences with Jesus involved a satanist. So cool. Sat on a plane, before the wheels had even gone up into the plane he is introducing himself as a satanist saying, "I am here to curse you."  
	I looked at him and I said, "Really?"  
	He said, "Yeah."  
	I said, "Cool\! Well, can you wait until we get to the right altitude because I want to get my notebook out of the overhead locker?"  
	He's going, "What?"  
	I said, "Dude, just wait."  
	So seat belt signs are turned off, I got up, got my notebook and my pen. I'm really excited. I said, "Man, I really appreciate you being here\!"  
	And he went, "What?"  
	I said, "I'm really glad you are here. Okay\! Let's have it\!"  
	So he starts telling me this curse, and I'm starting to write it down, and you know, after five minutes I stop him and I say, "This can't be all you've got. This is it? I mean, the first part was really interesting. This last bit, though, it's really boring, Dude. It's just boring. I mean, honestly, I'm starting to get annoyed." You just have to mess with the enemy's head. It's what they are there for\!  
	So I said, "Please tell me that you are winding up to something brilliant."  
	He was confused and he went, "Well, I'm almost done."  
	I said, "And you got on a plane to give me this? Dude, I'm not happy. When you said you were a satanist to curse me, I got really excited because *no weapon fashioned against me can prosper* and Jesus turned every curse into a blessing. I ain't going to get much blessing out of this\! So listen, here's the deal: I'm going to go back and use the restroom, and get a coke. Can I get you anything? Can I get you a coke or anything?"  
	He went, "No, I'm okay."  
	"I'll leave you alone for like twenty minutes, half an hour. Half an hour is good? Dude, just work on this, would you, because this is not clever. This is pretty boring. So can you work on it for me? That would be great. Appreciate it."  
	So I went back and talked to the flight attendant, had a can of coke, and then went back and said, "Okay, I'm going to pardon you for that first thing. Let's start with a brand new page, give me something\!" I just totally freaked him out, and he couldn't. That was funny\!  
	The thing is, he doesn't realize who is really in control. He is deceived.   
	Interesting how many Christians are deceived on that matter, too, eh? That when the enemy shows up with a curse, we all start getting tearful and anxious and worried, and all that kind of stuff. It's like, "Really?"   
	We are not deceived on who is Number One, and Number Two, and  Number Three, and the devil is not Number Four; that would be you. Number Five would be the angels.  
	There was a war in heaven. One-third of the angels fell and became demons, so we still outnumber the suckers two-to-one, and we have the Father, and we have the Son, and we have the Holy Spirit. This is not a fair fight\!  
	Did you ever see that movie with Indiana Jones when he is out in the middle east and he is walking down that alleyway and this guy all dressed in black with these two swords comes doing this, you know, and it's like that look of panic on Indy's face, it's like (sucking breath in), and suddenly he sees the light. It's a brilliant piece of acting. You see the light go on in his eyes, and he's going, "Ding\!" pulls out his gun and shoots him\! That is so funny\! And I feel this nudge from the Father, "See, see\! It's not a fair fight\! It's not a fair fight\!"  
	I'm going, "I'm trying to watch the movie\! Can we talk about this later?"  
	And it's like Holy Spirit is really excited, "It's not a fair fight\! That's what I've been trying to tell you\! I have to use Hollywood to get through to you, son\! It's not a fair fight\!"  
	It's a good fight, and a good fight is one that you don't lose because that would be a bad fight\!  
	Favor is not just about overcoming a negative. It's actually about taking advantage of it so that your mindset allows you to see beyond your limitations, so that you can learn to prosper from every circumstance.   
	Third epistle of John, which is an even smaller postcard, verse 2 says, *Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers.*  
	We are learning how to position ourself, our true self in Christ, to receive because we are always concentrating on who Jesus is for us. That's your privilege in every circumstance. "What is it You want to be for me now that You couldn't be at any other time?"  
	That kind of focus generates truth and power and enables us to pinpoint God's purpose in our situation. It's like it narrows it down to, "Ah\! That's what You are doing\! Okay, that's what I am looking at, then. That's what I am aligning myself with. That's my divine advantage right there," and we learn to pray in line with the purpose of God.  
	Effective prayer is never general. It is always specific. If I looked at you and said, "God has given me a brilliant prophetic word for you," then I turned and walked away, what would your question be? "What is it?" because you would be vaguely interested, right?   
	What if I were to say to you right now, though, "Jesus is making intercession for you. He is praying for you. He ever lives to make intercession for you." Now what's your question going to be? "What is He praying?"  
	Then if I was also to say, "Oh, and by the way, not only is Jesus praying, but the Holy Spirit is also groaning. (That's because He lives with you\! I'm sorry, I couldn't resist that one\!) He is groaning with intercession, and now what is your question going to be? "What's He praying, and does it agree with Jesus?"  
	What if prayer, in its purest form, is you've got the Godhead in stereo? Jesus in heaven, Holy Spirit on earth. He is praying something down, He is praying that you will pick it up.   
	What if you are the third part of a three-fold cord? What if prayer is not about praying towards God. What if it's about praying *with* God?   
	I wrote a book on that. It's called Crafted Prayer. Not "crafty prayer," but crafted prayer. I read it myself still because I love it. The thing I love about the book is it takes you away from the tyranny of your circumstances and settles you into the heart of God so that you can actually hear what God wants to say over you, and then you start to agree with Him. You are the third part of a three-fold cord of prayer.   
	So we are positioning ourselves to concentrate and pinpoint the purpose of God. Effective prayer is never general. The best prayers are always fashioned out of the truth that God wants you to live in. What truth are you embracing at this present time? Well your prayers can come out of that truth.   
	So for me right now I am learning over the last eighteen months, really just how to live in the joy of the Lord. So all of my prayers really start out with praise. "Lord, I am so joyful about this. Thank You so much," and I like that, you know, because I am condemned to joy\! I am a victim of joy. It's like (spoken sullenly), "I'm a victim of joy."The joy has to be in everything that I do, then, because I am being victimized by it\!    
	Here's the deal about favor: It empowers us to live in harmony with God's delight in Jesus in us. I just said it in Polish again, didn't I? I'm getting to understand that look on your face when you are all going (making a face).  
	Favor empowers us to live in harmony with God's delight in Jesus in us. God loves the Christ in you. The Holy Spirit is addicted to the Christ in you. All of Heaven comes to you because Jesus is in you. Christ in you attracts the blessing and the favor and the anointing of Heaven. It's why it's so great to be us\!  
	And the Holy Spirit is amazing at empowering us to experience the joy, and the pleasure, and the enjoyment, and the delight that the Father has in Jesus. "This is My Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, and I have just put Him into you\!" What does that make you? You are part of the package\!  
	Delight begets delight. God is delighted with Jesus in you. Live with it\!  
	In delight we are rejoicing in the intentions of God. It is His good pleasure to give us the Kingdom. Favor is based on God's desire for us.  
	Let me read you something else from the Bible. Numbers 6:23, *Speak to Aaron and to his sons saying, 'Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them, "The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make His face shine on you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up the light of His countenance upon you and give you peace." So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I then will bless them.'*  
	That's the Old Testament\! Brilliant. I'd take it in a heartbeat. It's the Old Testament, visitation. We are in the New Testament, habitation. The place of your delight is secure in Christ in you, the expectation of glory. We are just learning how to come away from the world's way of looking at things into the Kingdom's perception of your absolute reality. There is a reality in the Kingdom greater than any reality in the world for you. We do not take any of our cues from the world. We take them all from the Kingdom.  
	David wrote a psalm in the day that he was delivered from all the hands of his enemies. It's in 2 Samuel 22:20, and the line is (I never memorize Scripture. I just listen\! No, that's not true\! I like memorizing Scripture. I love it.) Here's the line in the song, though: *He also brought me forth into a broad place. He rescued me because He delighted in me.* Isn't that a great verse? It's part of a song. You don't want me to sing it because I don't want to ruin your day\!  
	*He brought me forth into a broad place, and He rescued me because He delighted in me.*   
	The enemy seeks to restrict your freedom, and he wants to constrict your place in the Spirit. Favor gets us out of the box that the enemy wants to put us in. The enemy has measured you for a coffin. God has measured you for abundance. Favor gets you out of the box that your own thinking gets you into. Favor empowers us to move into a broad place in God's delight. And so what happens is our testimony of God's delight in us is growing all the time, and our testimony empowers our favor, and our favor increases our testimony, and our testimony gives us power and authority to take what we have become and bestow it upon somebody else.   
	It is important for us to partner with delight because delight promotes discipline. All discipline is rooted in delight. Otherwise you are not going to enjoy it, and you are supposed to enjoy the disciplines. But each discipline is rooted in a passion. It comes with its own passion. So the discipline of prayer comes with the passion to pray.   
	People try and get hold of the discipline without getting hold of the passion first. If you get hold of the passion, you will love the discipline because you will want to achieve the purpose.  
	Favor enables us to live every day under the smile of God. Favor always reveals the affections of God. Favor provokes awareness of God's passion for us, and it reveals the attribute He wants us to live in, in this current period. So when God says, "Son, this is a joyful time for you," I am taking it for all I'm worth\!  
	So I like the delight that God has that my joy is increasing. I like the pleasure in His heart towards me. I like the way He is looking at me going, "Love it when that boy is happy\! Love just seeing the joy on his face. I love it that he is rising up. Love it that he has got more stamina. I love it that he is trusting Me for more. He is seeing more. He is believing more. I love it. I love it\! Look at that, he is my Beloved son, I am well pleased\! And when he changes, I am going to be well pleased. And when he changes again, I am going to be well pleased," because that's God. He is well pleased\! "I am well pleased with that\!" God looked at His creation, "That's good\! I am well pleased\! Holy Spirit, Me, well  pleased. Love that. See that tree? Well pleased with that. What about that cow we made yesterday? Well pleased with that cow. Brilliant\!"  
	I just think God is happy. He is the kindest person I know. I don't know anybody kinder than God, and I think His kindness is a real part of His delight and His passion. He doesn't have a thing against you because He took all of that away, nailed it to a tree. It's over. It's done. It's in the ground. It's in the tomb. Jesus took it to hell and left it there. Your problems are hell's problems right now. They are all stored up down there. Don't let them bring them back\! Don't let the enemy Fed-Ex your old identity back from hell. Don't let him do that\! You all got that picture, right?  
	Favor enables our heart to settle into a routine based upon His disposition towards us. That 's the nature of your walk. You are walking in the goodness of God towards you. You are walking in the love of God towards you. You are walking in the peace of God towards you. What are you walking in? You are walking in His disposition towards you.   
	You are not trying to evoke something in yourself to get somewhere with God. The way you come into salvation is the way that salvation is sustained. You didn't wake up one morning and say, "I know, it's Tuesday, it's a sunny day. I think I'll get saved today\!" No\! He sent some weird person to talk to you, and now you are one\!  
	He invaded your life and your time-space world and suddenly you were faced with something magnificent that you had to give in to. That's the Gospel. That's Jesus. So God initiated and you responded. The way you come into salvation is the way that salvation works. God initiates, you respond. You can't initiate. You have to respond to what God is doing.   
	One of the key aspects of abiding is that you need to let God bless you, and when He blesses you, you can respond to it. Every day let God touch you. Let God speak to you. Let Him smile on you. Let Him kiss you. Let Him say something to you. Your life is governed by His disposition towards you. Enjoy that\! It's extremely enjoyable. Our heart settles into a routine based upon His disposition towards us.   
	So don't be casual about your favor. Contemplate your favor so that you can inhabit the realm of God's intention towards you. You have to think about favor, not just thinking that it might creep up on you one day if you are lucky. You have to contemplate your favor. You have to set your stall out to receive favor. You have to ask the questions of the Holy Spirit, who loves questions. "What's my favor here? What's the upgrade here? What's the blessing here? What's the increase of Jesus here?"   
	You are going to have to work really hard so that you can get all the blessing and favor of God into your life before you die that you are supposed to have\! There is a storage facility in heaven that has got all your upgrades. You need to empty that place\! You have to catch up with the favor of God so that means you have to take responsibility for your blessing. Don't put it off, put it on\! Don't push it away, attract it towards you. Go out and grab it\!  
	You need to partner with God's affection for you. You need to partner with the enthusiasm of the Holy Spirit towards you. You need to partner with the fact that you have Christ within; you are irresistible to Heaven.   
	Make favor a lifestyle, not an event.  
	I did a whole series on favor. This message is not even in this one. There is a prophetic word on favor in here. There is a talk on favor being birthed in relationship with Jesus. There is a talk on how to train yourself in favor, how to overcome negatives with favor, how favor is attracted to your identity, how favor and the spirit of proclamation enables you to go after things that God has given you permission for, and there is a talk on the danger of only going halfway in favor.  
	Here's the question on favor: You have to ask the Lord, "What is Your highest good for me at this time?"   
	See, favor changes your character. Favor upgrades your relationship with God. Favor is growing focus on your privilege in Jesus. It is focusing on His intentional bias towards you. It is focusing on the fact that there is a divine advantage for you in the realm of the Spirit. Favor focuses on the love and the affection and your acceptance in the Lord Jesus Christ. Favor is the esteem of Heaven for all those in Christ.   
	The enemy always challenges God's affection for us. Therefore, God's passion for us is vital. Do you want me to say that again? The enemy challenges God's affection for us. Therefore, God's passion is most vital. When the enemy challenges God's affection, you need to move into His passion in a deeper way. Your favor will be contested, but the whole point of it being contested is so that you can grow in expectation. Favor is who you are in Jesus, regardless of your circumstances. Every situation is about the upgrade of your identity, your destiny, and your relationship with God. Don't be concerned about the opposition. Don't be concerned about what he is doing.  
	One of my mentors, when I would come into spiritual warfare and I would, you know, call one of my mentors up and say it was a real battle, and man, it was tough...he would just laugh and say, "Dude, it's not an adventure unless something goes wrong\!" I hate you right now. I'll talk to you next week\!   
	And he would say, "This is the whole point of warfare." Favor is the capacity to overcome by learning to receive under pressure. He said, "You took your eye off the ball. You put your eye on what the enemy was doing. You took your eye off God, and you took some lumps. Well, son, you need to learn. Favor is about keeping your eye on Jesus. He is the author and the finisher of your faith. You keep your eye on Him. You don't take your eye off the ball. You keep your eye on the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Favor keeps you focused. You lost focus and you lost a fight. Well, learn from it. You have to keep your focus, and if the enemy is pressing you, you need to learn how to receive under pressure."  
	Joy and delight are a part of that favor expression. I am in Christ. Heaven is attracted to Jesus in me. I can receive under these circumstances and, therefore, I will.   
	Favor makes us defiant against the enemy. It makes us assertive in battle. Favor teaches us to pay attention to our blessings in Jesus. The enemy looks for people to yield their favor and accept his measure. Favor in Jesus is always about an increase because everything He is doing is about fullness and abundance. He wants you to be fruitful. You fight with favor not towards it. You have favor now; take it with you on the journey. You don't be found in a situation trying to get favor. Practice the favor of God and take it with you.  
	Choose favor until your circumstances become favorable. Keep choosing favor and make it tangible. You have to believe for favor, expect favor, and then it will appear in fact. Choose favor until your circumstances become favorable. Don't allow your circumstances to dictate your blessing. Allow your placement in Jesus to promote your inheritance.   
	So you need to attack things with your favor. Whatever is contending against your identity can be attacked with the favor that you already possess in Christ.   
	A renewed mind will never contemplate a single day without favor.   
	It's appropriate to end this event on that note because, guys, Beloved, the whole point of thinking brilliantly is that you understand your place in the Kingdom and the favor that goes with it. God is biased towards you. It's time you started to live in that place of bias. It's time you took advantage of the enemy. It's time you prospered from what he was doing. Stop yielding your favor, an don't live below the line of your privilege. You are in Christ. It is your birthright to be advantaged. All of Heaven, there is a great cloud of witnesses wanting you to get it, and then wanting you to live it so that it becomes established in you, and your mindset cannot conceive of anything else. We are not double-minded. We need to stop it. We need to be single-minded. A mind set on Christ is always full of life and peace. A mind set on the Spirit, full of life and peace. A mind set on Christ always moving in delight and favor. Your mindset is never going to be the same because the Holy Spirit has just totally ruined you\! You're like, "Dang\! I can't go back to that life anymore. Can't go back to measure and mediocrity\! Been robbed\!"  
	Holy Spirit has ruined you. (singing:) You can't go back. There ain't no going back. There ain't no going back. There ain't no going....back.  
	You can't go back\! You ain't going back.  
	What we are going to do is move forward faster than we could ever have imagined. So, this is it\! Ta-da\! So excited.  
	Jesus took the curse and released a blessing instead. Live in the blessing. Christ in you, full expectation of something glorious occurring. You are God's treasure. You are a holy nation. You are His people. You are the people of His power, the people of His passion, the people of His heart, the people of His affection. You are more glorious than you know. You are stronger than you look. You are more brilliant than you can imagine. That is your identity. That is your destiny. That is who you are. Don't let anybody talk you out of that. Don't let anybody talk you down from a high place. You are in Christ. You are astonishing. At the very least, you are wonderful, but you might just be marvelous, Darling\!  
	So I declare over you that a transformation has already begun in your life. I declare over you that you will pursue the Lord into the full renewal of your thinking, that you will not quit, you will not give up, you will not step back, you will not sit down, you will no longer be overwhelmed. I declare to you that this is the year of your rising. This is the year of your rising. You are just like that hot air balloon. You are rising. You are rising. You are rising. You are untethered from the world. You are learning how to rise up in the Kingdom. There is an anointing upon you. You now have the capacity. It is in your hands to rise up in the name of Jesus, to rise up and occupy the space that has been set aside for you in the Kingdom since before the world began. I declare to you that you are highly favored. You are strong. You are powerful. You are the sons and the daughters of the Living God and no one can stand against you all the days of your life because Christ is in you, and He is your expectation of glory. I declare to you that when persecution comes upon you, a Spirit of God and of glory will fall upon you and rest upon you, and it will improve who you are. I declare to you that nothing the enemy is doing can upset the purposes of God in your life. But you are an overcomer learning to be more than a conqueror. You are powerful. You are strong. You are no longer a victim. You are not weak. You are not insubstantial. You are not insecure. You are not inadequate. You are learning. You are rising up into the fullness of your identity. You are discovering who you really are in Jesus, and I declare to you that at this moment in time, you have reached a point in your history where you will never be the same again because there is no going back. I declare to you, in the name of Jesus, that He has brought you from a narrow place, from a narrow space, He has brought you into a broad place because He has delighted in you, and He says to you, "I have closed the door behind you. I have closed the door behind you; you are in a new space. You cannot go back. I have closed it. I have locked it. I have bolted it. I have triple locked it, and I bricked it over, and I painted it. You can't even find that door back\! You are not going back. You are not going back. I declare to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you are a new creature, right here, right now. You are a new creature. You are a new creation. You have a new mind. You have a new persona. You have the favor of God. You have Christ living in you, and all of Heaven is attracted to you. Every situation is yours to prosper in. Everything carries a divine advantage. It carries the favor of Heaven. You are the Beloved of your Father. You are so the Beloved, and you are not going back. You are not going back\!   
	I declare over you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, there is a quickening spirit upon you because this is your time to make up for lost time. This is your time to get back on track with all that God has ever wanted to give you. He is redeeming time in your life, and He is doing that by speeding up your growth and your development. This quickening spirit, I have been releasing it all over the world. It   
is the capacity to make five years' growth in one year. It is the capacity to see your prophetic words fulfilled sooner than you think as you focus in on the process that God has for you. You can draw your future towards yourself. You can forget what lies behind, and in reaching out to what lies in front of you, the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus will become attracted to you, and somewhere in the middle you and God are going to meet and you are going to have an encounter that will mean the whole world to you. You are set on that process right now. I have set you on that path. You have a new way of thinking. You have new things to think about. You have new perceptions, new visions, new insight. You are a new person. You are a new creation. You are not going back the same person that came out. You are going back with a whole different way of being. The Lord says, "Your life is about divine advantage. It's about you living with intentional bias. It is about you not falling below the line of your privilege but rising up and occupying your rightful destiny in the Kingdom because of your identity in Jesus. This is who you are."

	You looked into the Kingdom this weekend and you saw yourself. You saw yourself. You saw who you really are. You saw it, you saw it, you saw it\! And now you are ruined\! Now you are ruined\! You saw yourself. You saw that strong person. You saw that knight in shining armor. You saw that warrior princess with the kick-butt boots. You saw that girl. You saw yourself in Jesus. You can't go back from that vision.   
	Beloved, you are not ordinary. There is not an ordinary person in this room. You are not mediocre. You are not average. You are in Christ. You are brilliant. You are wonderful. You are amazing, and you are going to learn how astonishing you are in the person of Jesus because you are destined to walk in majesty, and to live in His sovereignty, and to walk with the King, and to learn the power of the one with the One, and nothing shall be impossible for you. You will be able to do all things in Christ because there is a new strength coming from your favor and your joy and all the disposition of God towards you. This is your time to walk through this life with joy, with peace, with happiness, living as the Beloved, highly favored, blessed beyond the telling, living with astonishment and wonder, the living embodiment of the Good News of the sovereign grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the glad tidings of great joy. It is written on your heart. It will be seen on your face, and you will spread it everywhere you go. This is who you are. This is your truest identity, and I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to walk in the true knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, in all of His majesty, in all of His risen glory. That is who you are.   
	So, go forth and multiply\!

	So, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ be filled with the Holy Spirit, receive the Holy Spirit, receive fullness in the Holy Spirit. I command you in Jesus' name, stop living in one river. Buy a bigger boat. Rivers of living water, a well of water bubbling up into everlasting life. Receive the Holy Spirit. Be filled with the Holy Spirit. Get a new prayer language, in Jesus' name. You are going to need an upgraded language because you have new things to talk about. Receive the Holy Spirit. Be filled with Him. Be filled with the fruit of the Spirit. Be filled with all of His joy and all of His laughter, all of His gentleness and kindness. Be filled with the love of God. Be filled to overflowing. Everywhere you go, everyone you meet is going to be touched by the grace of God that is in you, and they will begin to see things in the Kingdom they have never seen because of you. But you are now released to be the gift of God to humanity, the son and daughter of the Living God, a visual aid to the earth of all that Heaven is like. Be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for Jesus' sake, because He deserves to be represented by excellence. He deserves excellence. So in His name, be released to be the person that He saw when He hung on a tree. He saw you. He knew you, and the Holy Spirit is birthing that identity in you. Embrace it. Don't fall away from it, but lean into it. It is your privilege to become that person for the sake of Jesus. Amen\!

	Thank you so much for being with us\!
